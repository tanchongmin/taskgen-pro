    "## Key Philosophy\n",
    "- It would be important to learn from past experience and improve the agentic framework - memory is key to that\n",
    "- You can add to the memory bank of your Agents pre-inference (by collecting from a pool of data prior to running the Agent), or during inference (add on in between running subtasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "- In general, for the various Memory classes, you use:\n",
    "    - `append(list_of_memories)`: append a list of memories to the memory bank\n",
    "    - `retrieve(task: str)`: retrieves top_k memories based on task \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Use Memory in Agents\n",
    "- Agent class takes `memory_bank` as a parameter during initialisation of an `Agent`\n",
    "- memory_bank: class Dict[Memory]. Stores multiple types of memory for use by the agent. Customise the Memory config within the Memory class."

    "## What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "ChromaDB Memory is a tool for storing and retrieving text-based information (like documents or tasks) using vector database technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Takes in the following parameters:\n",
    "    - `collection_name`: str. Compulsory. Name of the memory. Need to provide a unique name so that we can disambiguate between collections\n",
    "    - `client` - Default: None. ChromaDB client to use, if any\n",
    "    - `embedding_model`: Name of OpenAI's embedding_model to use with ChromaDB. Default OpenAI \"text-embedding-3-small\"\n",
    "    - `top_k`: Number of elements to retrieve. Default: 3\n",
    "    - `mapper`: Function. Maps the memory value to the embedded value. We do not need to embed the whole value, so this will serve as a way to tell us what to embed. Default: lambda x: x\n",
    "     - `pre_delete`: Bool. Default: False. If set to True, delete collection with all data inside it when initialising'''\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialize\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "memory = ChromaDbMemory(collection_name = \"collection_name\", top_k=5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add Information\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "memory.append([\"Task: Implement login feature\", \"Task: Fix homepage bug\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieve Information\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "results = memory.retrieve(\"login feature\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remove Information\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "memory.remove([\"Task: Implement login feature\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reset Entire ChromaDB colllection\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "memory.reset()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Async Version\n",
    "\n",
    "For applications needing asynchronous operations, use `AsyncChromaDbMemory`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async_memory = AsyncChromaDbMemory(top_k=5)\n",
    "\n",
    "await async_memory.append([\"Async task 1\", \"Async task 2\"])\n",
    "await async_memory.retrieve(\"task\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `add_file()` to add content from text files.\n",
    "- You can customize how information is stored using the `mapper` parameter when initializing.\n",
    "- For better performance in large applications, consider using a persistent ChromaDB client.\n"
