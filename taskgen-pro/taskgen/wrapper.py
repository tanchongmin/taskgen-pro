### Wrapper for Conversation that superclasses Agent
class ConversationWrapper(Agent):
    ''' This class takes an Agent and allows for conversational-based interactions with User / another Agent / Environment. Also updates persistent memory with latest information in conversation
    
    - Inputs:
        - **agent (compulsory)**: Agent. The agent we want to interact with
        - **persistent_memory**: dict. What kinds of memory the agent should have that persist over the entire conversation and their descriptions. Uses the same format as `output_format` of `strict_json`.
        - **person**: str. The name of the person you are talking to
        - **conversation**: List. The current existing conversation. Default: None
        - **num_past_conversation**: int. The number of past conversations to use for the agent
        - **verbose**: bool. Default: True. Whether to print the Agent's inner states
        
    - ConversationWrapper will automatically implement 3 new variables in `agent.shared_variables`:
        - **Persistent Memory**: The memory that will be updated as the conversation goes along, defined in persistent_dict
        - **Conversation**: The entire history of the conversation
        - **Summary of Conversation**: A summary of the current conversation
        
    - ConversationWrapper uses `chat()` which chats with the Agent and the Agent will perform actions and reply the chat message'''
