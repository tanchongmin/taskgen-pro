    "\n",
    "This code demonstrates a computer vision agent that can perform various image processing tasks using the `taskgen` library and OpenCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this code, you need to have the following installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python (version 3.6 or higher)\n",
    "2. `taskgen` library\n",
    "   - Install using `pip install taskgen`\n",
    "3. OpenCV (cv2)\n",
    "   - Install using `pip install opencv-python`\n",
    "4. NumPy\n",
    "   - Install using `pip install numpy`\n",
    "5. python-dotenv\n",
    "   - Install using `pip install python-dotenv`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure you have the required libraries installed as mentioned in the prerequisites.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a `.env` file in the parent directory of your project and add your OpenAI API key:\n",
    "```\n",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Place the example image file (`example_image.jpg`) in the same directory as the code file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the code file using a Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The code will perform the following tasks:\n",
    "- Resize the example image to a width of 800 and a height of 600.\n",
    "- Perform edge detection on the example image with a lower threshold of 100 and an upper threshold of 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The processed images will be saved as `resized_image.jpg` and `edge_image.jpg` in the same directory as the code file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The file paths of the processed images will be printed as the output of the agent's `run` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to read the example image file and write the processed image files in the directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code uses the `dotenv` library to load the OpenAI API key from the `.env` file. Make sure the `.env` file is properly configured with your API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `taskgen` library is used to create an agent and define functions for image processing tasks. Refer to the `taskgen` documentation for more information on its usage and capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The OpenCV library (cv2) is used for image processing operations such as resizing and edge detection. You can explore more OpenCV functionalities to extend the code as needed."
