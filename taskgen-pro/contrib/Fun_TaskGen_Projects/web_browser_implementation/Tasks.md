1. Environment Setup:
    - Choose a suitable operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, or Linux) for the experimental environment
    - Build a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) for the agent to interact with desktop applications
    - Provide real-time screenshots of the application's interface and a file (e.g., XML, JSON) detailing interactive elements
    - Assign unique identifiers to interactive elements using resource IDs or element properties like name, class, and content
    - Overlay semi-transparent numbers or labels on the screenshot for the agent to reference elements
2. Action Space Design:
    - Implement a simplified action space mirroring common human interactions with desktop applications:
        - Click(element: int): simulate a mouse click on a numbered UI element
        - Double_click(element: int): emulate a double-click on a UI element
        - Right_click(element: int): simulate a right-click on a UI element
        - Drag_and_drop(source_element: int, target_element: int): perform a drag-and-drop operation between two elements
        - Type(text: str): input text directly into an input field when it is focused
        - Press_key(key: str): simulate pressing a specific key (e.g., "Enter", "Escape", "Tab")
        - Navigate(direction: str): navigate between UI elements using arrow keys or tab key
3. Exploration Phase:
    - Implement two exploration strategies:
        1. Autonomous interactions:
            - Agent interacts with UI elements using different actions and observes changes
            - Analyzes screenshots before and after each action to understand element functions
            - Compiles information into a document recording action effects on elements
            - Updates document based on past documents and current observations for multiple interactions
            - Stops exploring irrelevant UI elements or windows and returns to the previous state
        2. Observing human demonstrations:
            - Agent observes human user operating the desktop application
            - Records only elements and actions employed by the human
        - Narrows down exploration space and prevents engaging with irrelevant elements or windows
4. Deployment Phase:
    - Implement a step-by-step approach for the agent to execute complex tasks:
        - Provide a screenshot of the current UI and a dynamically generated document in each step
        - Prompt the agent to observe the current UI, articulate its thought process, and execute actions
        - Incorporate interaction history and actions taken into the next prompt as a form of memory
        - Stop deployment when the agent determines task completion and takes an appropriate action (e.g., closing the application)
5. Integration with Multimodal Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-4):
    - Utilize the model's ability to process interleaved image-and-text inputs
    - Interpret and interact with both visual and textual information within the desktop applications
6. Evaluation and Testing:
    - Construct a benchmark with diverse desktop applications serving various purposes
    - Conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments to assess the agent's performance
    - Use metrics such as Successful Rate, Reward, and Average Steps to compare different design choices
    - Perform user studies for subjective evaluation, especially for open-ended tasks like image editing or document creation
    
By focusing on these key aspects and following the outlined steps, the multimodal agent framework can be implemented for desktop use. The modular design allows for flexibility in adapting to different desktop environments and integrating with multimodal large language models. The action space and exploration strategies may need to be adjusted to account for the differences between desktop and mobile interactions.
