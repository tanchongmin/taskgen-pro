Here you can contribute your own Jupyter Notebooks which uses TaskGen to do cool stuff!

As long as you use any part of TaskGen, from the full agentic pipeline to just a strict_json call to extract entities, you can put your Notebook here for others to reference!

Note below:
If you would like to change the core code of TaskGen (in the taskgen folder), you MUST contribute one fun project first so that you have an understanding of TaskGen's basic usage, before editing the code. Then, please arrange for a discussion with John Tan Chong Min (the overall cooridnator of the TaskGen GitHub) first before contributing any changes to the core code. Do reach out at the discord or LinkedIn! This ensures that the standards are maintained even while we accept open-sourced contributions.
