Based on language models, LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from text documents during a computationally intensive self-supervised and semi-supervised training process. LLMs can be used for text generation, a form of generative AI, by taking an input text and repeatedly predicting the next token or word.\\nLLMs are artificial neural networks. The largest and most capable, as of March 2024, are built with a decoder-only transformer-based architecture.\\nUp to 2020, fine tuning was the only way a model could be adapted to be able to accomplish specific tasks. Larger sized models, such as GPT-3, however, can be prompt-engineered to achieve similar results. They are thought to acquire knowledge about syntax, semantics and \"ontology\" inherent in human language corpora, but also inaccuracies and biases present in the corpora.\\nSome notable LLMs are OpenAI\\'s GPT series of models (e.g., GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, used in ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot), Google\\'s Gemini (the latter of which is currently used in the chatbot of the same name), Meta\\'s LLaMA family of models, Anthropic\\'s Claude models, and Mistral AI\\'s models.\\n\\nPage: Generative pre-trained transformer\\nSummary: Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are a type of large language model (LLM) and a prominent framework for generative artificial intelligence. They are artificial neural networks that are used in natural language processing tasks. GPTs are based on the transformer architecture, pre-trained on large data sets of unlabelled text, and able to generate novel human-like content. As of 2023, most LLMs have these characteristics and are sometimes referred to broadly as GPTs.\\nThe first GPT was introduced in 2018 by OpenAI. OpenAI has released very influential GPT foundation models that have been sequentially numbered, to comprise its \"GPT-n\" series. Each of these was significantly more capable than the previous, due to increased size (number of trainable parameters) and training. The most recent of these, GPT-4, was released in March 2023. Such models have been the basis for their more task-specific GPT systems, including models fine-tuned for instruction following—which in turn power the ChatGPT chatbot service. \\nThe term \"GPT\" is also used in the names and descriptions of such models developed by others. For example, other GPT foundation models include a series of models created by EleutherAI, and seven models created by Cerebras in 2023. Also, companies in different industries have developed task-specific GPTs in their respective fields, such as Salesforce\\'s \"EinsteinGPT\" (for CRM) and Bloomberg\\'s \"BloombergGPT\" (for finance).\\n\\nPage: DBRX\\nSummary: DBRX is an open-sourced large language model (LLM) developed by Mosaic ML team at Databricks, released on March 27, 2024.
