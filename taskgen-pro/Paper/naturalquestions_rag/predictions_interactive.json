( Although u was often used interchangeably with v , and the variant `` Evovae '' is occasionally used , the v in these cases would still be a vowel . ) The longest words with no repeated letters are dermatoglyphics , misconjugatedly and uncopyrightables . The longest word whose letters are in alphabetical order is the eight - letter Aegilops , a grass genus . However , this is arguably both Latin and a proper noun . There are several six - letter English words with their letters in alphabetical order , including abhors , almost , begins , biopsy , chimps and chintz .

There was a sudden and unexpected power surge . When operators attempted an emergency shutdown , a much larger spike in power output occurred . This second spike led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions . These events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air , causing it to ignite . For the next week , the resulting fire sent long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area , including Pripyat .

One widely held idea is that it was a quest for retaliation against continental Europeans for their previous invasions of Viking homelands , such as Charlemagne 's campaign to force Scandinavian pagans to convert to Christianity by killing any who refused to become baptized . The historian Rudolf Simek has observed , `` It is not a coincidence if the early Viking activity occurred during the reign of Charlemagne . '' Those who favor this explanation point out that the penetration of Christianity into Scandinavia caused serious conflict and divided Norway for almost a century . However , the first target of Viking raids was not the Frankish Kingdom , but Christian monasteries in England , which seems inconsistent with vengeance as a motive but would be consistent with religious warfare .",

Who rides there so late through the night dark and drear ? The father it is , with his infant so dear ; He holdeth the boy tightly clasp 'd in his arm , He holdeth him safely , he keepeth him warm . `` My son , wherefore seek'st thou thy face thus to hide ? '' `` Look , father , the Erl - King is close by our side ! Dost see not the Erl - King , with crown and with train ? '' `` My son , ' tis the mist rising over the plain . '' `` Oh , come , thou dear infant ! oh come thou with me ! For many a game I will play there with thee ; On my strand , lovely flowers their blossoms unfold , My mother shall grace thee with garments of gold . '' `` My father , my father , and dost thou not hear The words that the Erl - King now breathes in mine ear ? '' `` Be calm , dearest child , ' tis thy fancy deceives ; ' Tis the sad wind that sighs through the withering leaves . '' `` Wilt go , then , dear infant , wilt go with me there ? My daughters shall tend thee with sisterly care ; My daughters by night their glad festival keep , They 'll dance thee , and rock thee , and sing thee to sleep . '' `` My father , my father , and dost thou not see , How the Erl - King his daughters has brought here for me ? '' `` My darling , my darling , I see it aright , ' Tis the aged grey willows deceiving thy sight . '' `` I love thee , I 'm charm 'd by thy beauty , dear boy ! And if thou'rt unwilling , then force I 'll employ . '' `` My father , my father , he seizes me fast , For sorely the Erl - King has hurt me at last . '' The father now gallops , with terror half wild , He grasps in his arms the poor shuddering child ; He reaches his courtyard with toil and with dread , -- The child in his arms finds he motionless , dead .",

The poem is written in heroic couplets , and describes the decline of a village and the emigration of many of its residents to America . In the poem , Goldsmith criticises rural depopulation , the moral corruption found in towns , consumerism , enclosure , landscape gardening , avarice , and the pursuit of wealth from international trade . The poem employs , in the words of one critic , `` deliberately precise obscurity '' , and does not reveal the reason why the village has been deserted . The poem was very popular in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , but also provoked critical responses , including from other poets such as George Crabbe . References to the poem , and particularly its ominous `` Ill fares the land '' warning , have appeared in a number of other contexts .",

( The scarce and fugitive fifth halogen , the radioactive astatine , is not well - studied due to its expense and inaccessibility in large quantities , but appears to show various unusual properties due to relativistic effects . ) Iodine has an electron configuration of ( Kr ) 4d 5s 5p , with the seven electrons in the fifth and outermost shell being its valence electrons . Like the other halogens , it is one electron short of a full octet and is hence a strong oxidising agent , reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell , although in keeping with periodic trends , it is the weakest oxidising agent among the stable halogens : it has the lowest electronegativity among them , just 2.66 on the Pauling scale ( compare fluorine , chlorine , and bromine at 3.98 , 3.16 , and 2.96 respectively ; astatine continues the trend with an electronegativity of 2.2 ) . Elemental iodine hence forms diatomic molecules with chemical formula I , where two iodine atoms share a pair of electrons in order to each achieve a stable octet for themselves ; at high temperatures , these diatomic molecules reversibly dissociate a pair of iodine atoms . Similarly , the iodide anion , I , is the strongest reducing agent among the stable halogens , being the most easily oxidised back to diatomic I.

Work on the White Tower -- which gives the whole castle its name -- is usually considered to have begun in 1078 , however the exact date is uncertain . William made Gundulf , Bishop of Rochester , responsible for its construction , although it may not have been completed until after William 's death in 1087 . The White Tower is the earliest stone keep in England , and was the strongest point of the early castle . It also contained grand accommodation for the king . At the latest , it was probably finished by 1100 when Bishop Ranulf Flambard was imprisoned there . Flambard was loathed by the English for exacting harsh taxes . Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower , he was also the first person to escape from it , using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine . He was held in luxury and permitted servants , but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors . After plying them with drink , when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber , and out of the Tower .

The flow rate of the Jordan River once was 1.3 billion cubic metres per year ; as of 2010 , just 20 to 30 million cubic metres per year flow into the Dead Sea .

It is a region consisting chiefly of mountains in the north and desert in the south . The earliest home of men in this great arena of Western Asia is a borderland between the desert and the mountains , a kind of cultivable fringe of the desert , a fertile crescent having the mountains on one side and the desert on the other . This fertile crescent is approximately a semicircle , with the open side toward the south , having the west end at the southeast corner of the Mediterranean , the center directly north of Arabia , and the east end at the north end of the Persian Gulf ( see map , p. 100 ) . It lies like an army facing south , with one wing stretching along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean and the other reaching out to the Persian Gulf , while the center has its back against the northern mountains . The end of the western wing is Palestine ; Assyria makes up a large part of the center ; while the end of the eastern wing is Babylonia . This great semicircle , for lack of a name , may be called the Fertile Crescent . It may also be likened to the shores of a desert - bay , upon which the mountains behind look down -- a bay not of water but of sandy waste , some eight hundred kilometres across , forming a northern extension of the Arabian desert and sweeping as far north as the latitude of the northeast corner of the Mediterranean . This desert - bay is a limestone plateau of some height -- too high indeed to be watered by the Tigris and Euphrates , which have cut ca\u00f1ons obliquely across it . Nevertheless , after the meager winter rains , wide tracts of the northern desert - bay are clothed with scanty grass , and spring thus turns the region for a short time into grasslands . The history of Western Asia may be described as an age - long struggle between the mountain peoples of the north and the desert wanderers of these grasslands -- a struggle which is still going on -- for the possession of the Fertile Crescent , the shores of the desert - bay . There is no name , either geographical or political , which includes all of this great semicircle ( see map , p. 100 ) . Hence we are obliged to coin a term and call it the Fertile Crescent .",

Important Supreme Court decisions that undermined these amendments were the Slaughter - House Cases in 1873 , which prevented rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment 's privileges or immunities clause from being extended to rights under state law ; and Plessy v.

These stages are prophase , prometaphase , metaphase , anaphase , and telophase .

The result is two genetically identical daughter nuclei . The rest of the cell may then continue to divide by cytokinesis to produce two daughter cells . Producing three or more daughter cells instead of normal two is a mitotic error called tripolar mitosis or multipolar mitosis ( direct cell triplication / multiplication ) .

At the same time he conceded `` applicability '' as being within the `` freedom '' of the reader , and indeed many people have been inclined to view the One Ring as a symbol or metaphor . The notion of a power too great for humans to safely possess is an evocative one , and already in the 1930s there were technologies available to suggest the idea . By the time the work was published , though not when most of it was written , the existence of nuclear power and nuclear weapons were common knowledge , and the Ring was often taken as symbolic of them . The effect of the Ring and its physical and spiritual after - effects on Bilbo and Frodo are obsessions that have been compared with drug addiction ; actor Andy Serkis who played Gollum in the film trilogy cited drug addiction as an inspiration for his performance .",

Leonowens ' stories were autobiographical , although various elements of them have been called into question . The film stars Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner .",

            "sentence": "Dwight is the only person that Angela likes in the office . It is shown in `` E-mail Surveillance '' that Dwight and Angela have begun a romantic relationship . Although she has said she loves Dwight and cares about him , she refuses to tell anyone about their relationship , and is often made uncomfortable by Dwight 's passion for her . Their relationship is seemingly summarized in `` A.A.R.M. '' : when Dwight tells her that yelling through a megaphone expresses `` how loudly I love you '' , Angela meekly whispers `` It 's too loud . '' In `` Traveling Salesman '' Angela forgets to send an accounting folder to corporate , so Dwight drives to New York and gives the folder to them . After Dwight is told he would be fired if he did n't tell Michael why he went to New York , he keeps their relationship secret out of respect for Angela . Angela later tells Michael what happened , but still does n't reveal their relationship . In `` Fun Run '' Angela asks Dwight to feed her cat Sprinkles , who is feeling sick , but Dwight kills it , which causes Angela to break up with him . After Angela begins a relationship with Andy in Season 4 , she stops dating Dwight , but at the end of `` Goodbye Toby '' Phyllis sees Angela cheating on Andy with Dwight . Dwight ends their affair in `` The Duel '' after learning that she has been having sexual relations with Andy . In `` The Delivery '' Dwight , who wants to improve his sales by having a child , asks Angela to have his baby . The two write up a contract and plan to have a baby together , but in `` Happy Hour '' , Dwight hooks up with Pam 's friend Isabel , and tells Angela he does n't want her to have his baby . In `` The Chump '' the two call in a lawyer , and Angela refuses to release him from the contract unless he agrees to have sex with her five times . She later voids the contract after meeting Senator Robert Lipton . After she gives birth ( Jury Duty ) , Dwight realizes the baby was conceived before her marriage to Robert and makes the assumption that he , not Robert , is the father . Angela and Dwight go through a paternity test and in `` New Guys '' it is revealed that Dwight is not Philip 's father . In `` A.A.R.M. '' Dwight proposes to Angela , and she accepts . She then tells Dwight that she lied before and Dwight is Philip 's father . Angela tells him that she wanted to make sure that Dwight wanted to marry her for no other reason than for love .",

Rosie immediately disliked Elizabeth and viewed her as `` the competition , '' but eventually came to really care about Elizabeth , even if she has a hard time showing it . At the beginning of season 2 , Rosemary began working at the cafe with Abigail and the two quickly became friends .

Lee then tells her that he has another `` role '' that he thinks would be perfect for her and proposes marriage . She happily accepts . In `` Hearts In Question , '' Rosemary enthusiastically plans for their wedding . The couple weds in the season 3 finale `` Prayers From The Heart , '' with Elizabeth and Abigail as her maids of honor .

When timber becomes Coal Valley 's major source of natural resources , the town is renamed Hope Valley . He shares a mutual attraction to Rosemary and proves to be one of the few people who can outwit her . When she declines his romantic intentions , Lee recruits his friend , Molly Sullivan , to make Rosemary jealous ; the ploy succeeds and Rosemary accepts his suit , appreciating Lee 's good qualities . Despite her dramatic and occasionally prickly personality , Lee 's compassion and patience never fails with her . With Rosemary 's help , Lee beat Mr. Gowen at his own game in `` Heart and Home . '' When not at work , Lee enjoys being with friends , including Jack Thornton , who shares Lee 's simple and laidback outlook , allowing the men to discuss their lives and exchange romantic advice . In season 3 , Lee 's mill is unfortunately sabotaged by a man inside . Through Bill and Jack 's investigation , they find the culprit .

'' Molly is reunited with her daughter , to the joy of the town 's people .

In his first appearance , he flirts with Meredith Grey , and Derek punches him in the face . Derek explains that Mark had an affair with his wife , Addison ( Kate Walsh ) while they were living in New York . Mark travels to Seattle , intent on convincing Addison to return with him , but his offer is rejected and Derek declines to renew their friendship . Mark returns during season three at Addison 's drunken behest , but she again rejects him once sober . Undeterred , Mark sells his successful private practice ( which he previously shared with Derek ) and takes over the plastics program at Seattle Grace Hospital . During Meredith 's morphine rampage , Mark finds out about his nickname McSteamy which was given to him by her during his first trip to Seattle back when he attempted to get Addison back and earn Derek 's friendship back . It is later revealed that Mark has at some point slept with all of Derek 's sisters . Mark has a brief fling with Addison 's friend , orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres ( Sara Ramirez ) , and develops a friendship with Derek 's girlfriend , intern Meredith Grey ( Ellen Pompeo ) . It is revealed that after Derek left New York , Mark and Addison continued their relationship for two months , during which she conceived and aborted his child . Just weeks after moving to Seattle he quickly observes that Derek 's true love was Meredith and tries to convince Addison that her marriage with Derek was over . Mark enters into a sixty - day abstinence pact with Addison , agreeing that if they can remain celibate for that time , Addison will give their relationship another chance . Addison ultimately breaks the pact by having sex with intern Alex Karev ( Justin Chambers ) , and soon thereafter departs from Seattle to work in Los Angeles .",

While the key carrier technology of the first Industrial Revolution ( 1770 -- 1850 ) was based on water - powered mechanization , the second Kondratiev wave ( 1850 -- 1900 ) was enabled by steam - powered technology , the third ( 1900 -- 1940 ) was characterized by the electrification of social and productive organization , the fourth by motorization and the automated mobilization of society ( 1940 -- 1970 ) , and the most recent one by the digitization of social systems . Each one of those so - called long waves has been characterized by a sustained period of social modernization , most notably by sustained periods of increasing economic productivity . According to Carlota Perez : `` this quantum jump in productivity can be seen as a technological revolution , which is made possible by the appearance in the general cost structure of a particular input that we could call the ' key factor ' , fulfilling the following conditions : ( 1 ) clearly perceived low - and descending - relative cost ; ( 2 ) unlimited supply for all practical purposes ; ( 3 ) potential all - pervasiveness ; ( 4 ) a capacity to reduce the costs of capital , labour and products as well as to change them qualitatively '' . Digital Information and Communication Technologies fulfill those requirements and therefore represent a general purpose technology that can transform an entire economy , leading to a modern , and more developed form of socio - economic and political organization often referred to as the post-industrial society , the fifth Kondratiev , Information society , digital age , and network society , among others .",

Chief Richard Webber is under a lot of stress from everything that 's been going on , and it is believed that he is having a heart attack , which lures his wife Adele to the hospita ( anxiety attack ) ) .

Job losses were less severe among women , workers in nondurable industries ( such as food and clothing ) , services and sales workers , and those employed by the government . Unskilled inner city men had much higher unemployment rates . Age also played a factor : young people had a hard time getting their first job , and men over the age of 45 , if they lost their job , would rarely find another one because employers had their choice of younger men . Millions were hired in the Great Depression , but men with weaker credentials were never hired , and fell into a long - term unemployment trap . The migration that brought millions of farmers and townspeople to the bigger cities in the 1920s suddenly reversed itself , as unemployment made the cities unattractive , and the network of kinfolk and more ample food supplies made it wise for many to go back . City governments in 1930 - 31 tried to meet the depression by expanding public works projects , as president Herbert Hoover strongly encouraged . However , tax revenues were plunging , and the cities as well as private relief agencies were totally overwhelmed by 1931 ; no one was able to provide significant additional relief . People fell back on the cheapest possible relief , soup kitchens which provided free meals for anyone who showed up . After 1933 new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress of the cities , but the budgets did not fully recover until 1941 .",

            "sentence": "During World War II , `` Wimpy '' , in reference to the character , was the nickname given to the Vickers Wellington bomber . Wimpy is also the namesake of the large chain of Wimpy hamburger restaurants which was founded in Bloomington , Indiana in the 1930s and opened in the UK in 1954 ; it has maintained operations overseas since 1967 . Their UK website states , `` The name Wimpy is believed to have come from Popeye 's friend J Wellington Wimpy who loved hamburgers as much as Popeye loved spinach . '' Wimpy can also be found as the mascot for `` Wimpy 's Seafood Restaurant and Market '' in Osterville , MA on Cape Cod . ( Established 1938 ) Wimpy made a cameo appearance ( as an in - gag to both his facial features ; in the context of beef related heart disease and affinity for hamburgers ) in the Family Guy episode `` McStroke '' . Wimpy has appeared in two episodes of the Adult Swim animated series Robot Chicken , often using his `` I 'll gladly pay you Tuesday '' line to buy hamburgers . Often it fails . Voiced by Scott Adsit . In the Good Eats second season episode `` Daily Grind '' ( aka `` A Grind is a Terrible Thing to Waste '' ) , Alton Brown prepares the `` perfect burger '' ( as well as meatloaf & meatballs ) for a character named `` J. Wellington Whimpy '' ( misspelled , but looking mostly like the version of Wimpy played by Paul Dooley in the Popeye film ) played by then cast regular Steve Rooney . In the final Pooch the Pup cartoon called She Done Him Right , a dog character looking like Wimpy is seen playing a slot machine . Wimpy 's famous catchphrase gives the name to the hamburger review website A Hamburger Today . Wimpy is also the focus of an animated Bank of America commercial in which he uses a new smartphone app to finally pay for the food he mooched from his friends . Season 4 Episode 6 of Cheers is named `` I 'll Gladly Pay You Tuesday '' . In the hit video game World of Warcraft , an NPC can be heard repeating `` I 'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today '' in the city of Stormwind .",

Children do not have to work at finding the place where the sidewalk ends , they know . They know because they know nothing else , the joyful , imaginative mindset they have is purely natural .

Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago . In vertebrates it consists of two main parts , the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord . The PNS consists mainly of nerves , which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons , that connect the CNS to every other part of the body . Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves , while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent . Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves . The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems , the somatic , autonomic , and enteric nervous systems . Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement . The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy , while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state . The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system . Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily . Nerves that exit from the cranium are called cranial nerves while those exiting from the spinal cord are called spinal nerves .",

            "sentence": "In Argentina , the V sign , besides `` victory '' , is linked to a political movement , Peronism . In South Africa after the Nationalist Party won the 1948 election with less voters than the opposition , V 's appeared as graffiti representing the word `` Volkswil '' ( will of the people ) and questioning thus the results . University of Southern California , University of Virginia , The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley , and Villanova University students , alumni , and fans `` throw their Vs up '' in tradition and as a sign of pride of their university and athletic teams . The V sign in this form frequently accompanies the motto `` Fight on ! '' at USC . V sign , especially when printed in green , is a sign of the Iranian Green Movement . After the first elections in Iraq after the U.S. Invasion , a well known photo was circulated of a woman showing the V sign with one of her fingers dipped in purple ink . The ink is used to identify individuals who have already voted . In Poland during the Solidarity movement , protesters showed the V sign meaning they would defeat Communism . After partially free elections , when Tadeusz Mazowiecki was chosen as prime minister ( August 24 , 1989 ) , he went to the MPs with the V sign , which was transmitted on TV . It is sometimes shown during debates about the fall of Communism . In Romania the sign represents victory and has been used as an extension of the Roman salute to announce that victory has been achieved . It was used heavily during the Romanian revolution after the ousting of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu . Mircea Dinescu is appearing in the first transmission of the Romanian Television after the revolutionaries occupied it shouting `` We won ! '' and flashing the victory sign . During the Yugoslav Wars , Croatian and Bosnian troops and paramilitary militia used the sign as a greeting or an informal salute . U.S. and NATO peacekeepers stationed in Bosnia were forbidden to use the V - sign ( peace symbol ) to avoid upsetting or offending Serbs they might encounter . In Vietnam , the V sign means `` hello '' since the Vietnamese word for the number `` 2 '' sounds like the English pronunciation of the greeting `` hi '' . Ringo Starr of the Beatles uses the V sign extensively while quoting the phrase `` Peace and Love '' as a sort of catchphrase . A variation is to put the V sign with the fingers on either side of the mouth ( usually with the knuckles facing the observer ) and to stick the tongue out . Most of the time the tongue is wriggled around . This is used to signify cunnilingus and the gesture is often off - colour . A partially obscured V sign can be added to someone else 's head to produce devil 's horns or `` bunny ears '' for an amusing photo . In September 2013 , Manu Tuilagi apologised to Prime Minister David Cameron after making a `` bunny ears '' sign behind his head in a photo taken during a visit by the British and Irish Lions squad to Downing Street . In Indonesia , candidate of presidential election Joko Widodo use that sign for political campaign . The sign called `` Salam Dua Jari '' . In Belgium , the New Flemish Alliance ( N - VA ) political party uses it as a rallying gesture . During the taking the oath of the actual Belgian federal government , three N - VA ministers used the V sign instead of the formal three - fingers sign .",

            "sentence": "Kristen Bell as Eleanor Shellstrop , a deceased saleswoman from Arizona who entered an afterlife utopia called `` The Good Place '' seemingly after being mistaken for a human rights lawyer by the same name . With the aid of her alleged soulmate , Chidi , she attempts to reform by learning about ethics , believing she still has a chance to earn a legitimate spot in The Good Place . Now that Eleanor knows about Michael 's experiments and the memory wipes , Eleanor became the de facto leader in the group `` Team Cockroach '' after she makes a truce with Michael to keep Shawn from finding out about the reboots in exchange for helping the humans get to the Real Good Place . William Jackson Harper as Chidi Anagonye , a deceased ethics professor who was born in Nigeria and raised in Senegal , supposed to be Eleanor 's soulmate . Reluctantly , he had hope to meet a soulmate he could bond with , but soon discovers that he and Eleanor were meant to be soulmates because he was always there for her . He is the first person to learn her secret and begins teaching her about ethics to reform both her and Jason . He died on earth when an air conditioner fell on his head outside his apartment building . Chidi speaks French , but in this afterlife , his speech is translated into whatever languages people who listen to him speak ; therefore , he appears to speak English to Eleanor and the audience . Jameela Jamil as Tahani Al - Jamil , a deceased , wealthy philanthropist who traveled extensively around the world . She was born in Pakistan , raised in England , and went to school in France . Tahani , whose full name means `` Congratulations Beautiful , '' is a seemingly - good - natured soul with a cheerful and helpful attitude who was constantly overshadowed by her younger sister , Kamilah during her time on Earth . She died on Earth when a statue of her sister fell on her at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland , Ohio . She gradually learns the truth about Eleanor and Jason following Eleanor 's arrival . Initially , Eleanor dislikes Tahani , finding her positive attitude , condescending manner , and her tendency to name drop obnoxious , but the two eventually become friends . D'Arcy Carden as Janet , a programmed guide who acts as the neighborhood 's main source of information , analogous to an intelligent personal assistant . She is the 25th generation of `` Janet '' programs like her , dating back to a predecessor featuring a click - wheel . She has infinite knowledge of the universe , can provide residents anything they desire , and details everything of what is happening in the Good Place but does have some flaws . Since she is the only individual who came from a true Good Place ( Michael admits to having stolen her in the season 1 finale ) , Janet is subject to numerous reboots ; she pleads with whomever tries to push a red button that shuts her down not to kill her , even going as far as showing pictures ( like an ultrasound of an unborn baby or showing off her `` children '' ) before she falls to the ground . These reboots give Janet increased abilities as well as programming capabilities that compel her to make humans happy , as she 'll only answer to what the humans want her to do , including keeping their secrets to escaping the Bad Place . Janet is incompatible with lies and must tell the objective truth . In season 1 , after she was rebooted the first time , Jason and Janet fell in love with each other and got married . Despite the fact Janet is not human , she and Jason attempted many times in vain to consummate their marriage , without success . It is revealed in season 2 that her feelings for Jason have intensified with each reboot . Also in season 2 , as Janet becomes more self aware with each reboot , she realizes that the experimental created neighborhood may explode or implode due to her computer glitches , and she begs Michael to `` kill '' her and turn her into a marble . Demon Michael , after having attended so many of Chidi 's lessons on ethics and philosophy , can not bring himself to permanently disable Janet , because Michael now considers Janet to be his best friend . Since Michael will not agree to permanently disable her and turn her into a marble , in order to pacify herself and avoid further earthquakes and the possible destruction of the neighborhood Janet creates a new boyfriend for herself . The boyfriend Janet creates is as anatomically incorrect as she is , with wind chimes for genitalia . Carden also plays `` Bad Janet '' , Janet 's counterpart from The Bad Place . Manny Jacinto as `` Jianyu Li '' , a supposedly silent Buddhist monk from Taiwan and Tahani 's soulmate . Eleanor discovers he is actually Jason Mendoza from Jacksonville , Florida , an amateur DJ , devoted Jacksonville Jaguars fan , and backup dancer who sold fake drugs to high school students . At first , Jason develops feelings for Janet because she is the only one who is nice to him but later forgot after they rebooted everybody 's memories , but later ended up sleeping with Tahani in season 2 . Ted Danson as Michael , the architect of The Good Place where Eleanor and her fellow humans reside . In the first - season finale , it is discovered that he is a Bad Place demon who constructed a fake `` Good Place '' to torture Eleanor , Chidi , Tahani , and Jason . Unfortunately , he ends up repeatedly restarting his experiment due to Eleanor ( and one time Jason ) always figuring out that `` The Good Place '' is `` The Bad Place , '' leading to his routine failure , as well as hiding the constant resets from Shawn in order to avoid `` retirement '' . As part of a truce he makes with Eleanor so his failing project will not be exposed and a chance to reform his behavior , Michael agrees to let the humans keep their memories and help them get into the true Good Place as well as to take Chidi 's ethics lessons .",

            "sentence": "The last 20 years have seen a popular revival of interest in the historic verse controversies and the textual debate . Factors include the growth of interest in the Received Text and the Authorized Version ( including the King James Version Only movement ) and the questioning of Critical Text theories , the 1995 book by Michael Maynard documenting the historical debate on 1 John 5 : 7 , and the internet ability to spur research and discussion with participatory interaction . In this period , King James Bible defenders and opponents wrote a number of papers on the Johannine Comma , usually published in evangelical literature and on the internet . In textual criticism scholarship circles , the book by Klaus Wachtel Der byzantinische Text der katholischen Briefe : Eine Untersuchung zur Entstehung der Koine des Neuen Testaments , 1995 contains a section with detailed studies on the Comma . Similarly , Der einzig wahre Bibeltext ? , published in 2006 by K. Martin Heide . Special interest has been given to the studies of the Codex Vaticanus umlauts by Philip Barton Payne and Paul Canart , senior paleographer at the Vatican Library . The Erasmus studies have continued , including research on the Valladolid inquiry by Peter G. Bietenholz and Lu Ann Homza . Jan Krans has written on conjectural emendation and other textual topics , looking closely at the Received Text work of Erasmus and Beza . And some elements of the recent scholarship commentary have been especially dismissive and negative .",

In the muscle , there are groups of highly specialized cells that work together to perform a function known as muscle contraction . A main component in the cytoskeleton that helps show the true function of this muscle contraction is known as a microfilament . Microfilaments are composed of the most abundant cellular protein known as actin . During contraction of a muscle , within each muscle cell , myosin molecular motors collectively exert forces on parallel actin filaments . Muscle contraction starts from nerve impulses which then causes increased amounts of calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum . Increases in calcium in the cytosol allows muscle contraction to begin with the help of two proteins , tropomyosin and troponin . Tropomyosin inhibits the interaction between actin and myosin , while troponin senses the increase in calcium and releases the inhibition . This action contracts the muscle cell , and through the synchronous process in many muscle cells , the entire muscle .",

            "sentence": "Norman Davies notes that Golden Liberty , the Nobles ' Democracy ( Rzeczpospolita Szlachecka ) arose in the Kingdom of Poland and Polish - Lithuanian Commonwealth . This foreshadowed a democracy of about ten percent of the population of the Commonwealth , consisting of the nobility , who were an electorate for the office of the King . They observed Nihil novi of 1505 , Pacta conventa and King Henry 's Articles ( 1573 ) . See also : Szlachta history and political privileges , Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish - Lithuanian Commonwealth , Organisation and politics of the Polish - Lithuanian Commonwealth . The Case of Proclamations ( 1610 ) in England decided that `` the King by his proclamation or other ways can not change any part of the common law , or statute law , or the customs of the realm '' and that `` the King hath no prerogative , but that which the law of the land allows him . '' Dr. Bonham 's Case ( 1610 ) , decided that `` in many cases , the common law will control Acts of Parliament '' . The Virginia House of Burgesses , established in 1619 , is the first representative legislative body in the New World . The Mayflower Compact , signed in 1620 , an agreement between the Pilgrims , on forming a government between themselves , based on majority rule . During a period of renewed interest in Magna Carta , the Petition of Right ( 1628 ) was passed by the Parliament of England . It established , among other things , the illegality of taxation without parliamentary consent and of arbitrary imprisonment . The idea of the political party with factions took form in Britain around the time of the English Civil War ( 1642 -- 1651 ) . Soldiers from the Parliamentarian New Model Army and a faction of Levellers freely debated rights to political representation during the Putney Debates of 1647 . The Levellers published a newspaper ( The Moderate ) and pioneered political petitions , pamphleteering and party colours . Later , the pre-war Royalist ( then Cavalier ) and opposing Parliamentarian groupings became the Tory party and the Whigs in the Parliament . English Act of Habeas Corpus ( 1679 ) , safeguarding individual freedom against unlawful imprisonment with right to appeal ; one of the documents integral to the constitution of the United Kingdom and the history of the parliament of the United Kingdom . William Penn wrote his Frame of Government of Pennsylvania in 1682 . The document gave the colony a representative legislature and granted liberal freedoms to the colony 's citizens . A bill of rights is enacted by the Parliament of England in 1689 . The Bill of Rights 1689 set out the requirement for regular parliaments , free elections , rules for freedom of speech in Parliament , and limited the power of the monarch . It ensured ( with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 ) that , unlike much of the rest of Europe , royal absolutism would not prevail .",

The author also displays an accurate knowledge of Persian customs and palaces . However , according to Coogan , considerable historical inaccuracies remain throughout the text , supporting the view that the book of Esther is to be read as a historical novella which tells a story describing historical events but is not necessarily historical fact . Edwin M. Yamauchi has questioned the reliability of other historical sources , such as Herodotus , to which Esther has been compared . Yamauchi wrote , `` ( Herodotus ) was , however , the victim of unreliable informants and was not infallible . '' The reason for questioning the historical accuracy of such ancient writers as Herodotus is that he is one of the primary sources of knowledge for this time period , and it has been frequently assumed that his account may be more accurate than Esther 's account . However , Jewish scholars and historians such as Mitchell First point out that although Herodotus traveled widely in the 460s and 450s B.C.E. , he probably never set foot in Persia , and his information about Persia is exclusively based , therefore , on what was told to him orally . As a consequence , if the presumed - reliable sources with which Coogan contrasts the book of Esther are not , in fact , reliable , then Coogan 's claims regarding Esther can not be said to hold historical weight .",

            "sentence": "Youngstown Sheet and Tube 's announcement had a ripple effect in the area . In 1979 -- 1980 , U.S. Steel pulled out of the Youngstown area and started scaling back its operations in Pittsburgh before eventually merging with Marathon Oil and filing with bankruptcy . In the mid-1980s , Republic Steel also filed for bankruptcy . Attempts to revive the local steel industry proved unsuccessful . Shortly after the closure of most of Youngstown Sheet and Tube 's area operations , local religious leaders , steelworkers , and activists such as Staughton Lynd participated in a grassroots effort to purchase and refurbish one of the company 's abandoned plants in neighboring Campbell , Ohio . This project met with failure in April 1979 . The failure to reopen the mills led Youngstown State University professors Terry Buss and F. Stevens Redburn to conclude that the mill closings resulted from forces beyond the control of the community . Youngstown was simply just one piece of a national problem , and there was no way that Youngstown could solve this problem alone . In 1982 , Staughton Lynd wrote about the effects of the mill closings in Youngstown in the book entitled The Fight Against Black Monday . In the wake of the steel plant shutdowns , the community lost an estimated 40,000 manufacturing jobs , 400 satellite businesses , $414 million in personal income , and from 33 to 75 percent of the school tax revenues . The Youngstown area has yet to fully recover from the loss of jobs in the steel sector .",

An All - India Committee for Cooperation with the Simon Commission was established by the Council of India and by selection of the Viceroy , Lord Irwin . The members of the committee were : C. Sankaran Nair ( Chairman ) , Arthur Froom , Nawab Ali Khan , Shivdev Singh Uberoi , Zulfiqar Ali Khan , Hari Singh Gour , Abdullah Al - Mamun Suhrawardy , Kikabhai Premchand and M.C. Rajah . In Burma ( Myanmar ) , which was included in the terms of reference of the Simon Commission , there was strong suspicion either that Burma 's unpopular union with India would continue , or that the constitution recommended for Burma by the Commission would be less generous than that chosen for India ; these suspicions resulted in tension and violence in Burma leading to the rebellion of Saya San .",

            "sentence": "After Scheidemann \u2032 s resignation , a new coalition government was formed under Gustav Bauer . President Friedrich Ebert knew that Germany was in an impossible situation . Although he shared his countrymen 's disgust with the treaty , he was sober enough to consider the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject it . He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty , the Allies would invade Germany from the west -- and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion . With this in mind , he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event the Allies resumed the war . If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out , Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty . Hindenburg -- after prodding from his chief of staff , Wilhelm Groener -- concluded the army could not resume the war even on a limited scale . However , rather than inform Ebert himself , he had Groener inform the government that the army would be in an untenable position in the event of renewed hostilities . Upon receiving this , the new government recommended signing the treaty . The National Assembly voted in favour of signing the treaty by 237 to 138 , with five abstentions ( there were 421 delegates in total ) . This result was wired to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline . Foreign minister Hermann M\u00fcller and colonial minister Johannes Bell travelled to Versailles to sign the treaty on behalf of Germany . The treaty was signed on 28 June 1919 and ratified by the National Assembly on 9 July by a vote of 209 to 116 .",

However , there have also been seven instances in Test cricket , and two in ODIs , where a batsman has been dismissed handled the ball , a mode of dismissal now folded into obstructing the field . In most cases an obstruction occurs when a batsman thinks that he is going to be run out and he blocks the ball with his bat or changes his course while running between wickets to block the ball .

            "sentence": "Beginning with the test administered in April 1995 , the SAT score scale was recentered to return the average math and verbal scores close to 500 . Although only 25 students had received perfect scores of 1600 in all of 1994 , 137 students taking the April test scored a 1600 . The new scale used a reference group of about one million seniors in the class of 1990 : the scale was designed so that the SAT scores of this cohort would have a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 110 . Because the new scale would not be directly comparable to the old scale , scores awarded on April 1995 and later were officially reported with an `` R '' ( for example , `` 560R '' ) to reflect the change in scale , a practice that was continued until 2001 . Scores awarded before April 1995 may be compared to those on the recentered scale by using official College Board tables . For example , verbal and math scores of 500 received before 1995 correspond to scores of 580 and 520 , respectively , on the 1995 scale .",

In 1977 , Michel Ugon from Honeywell Bull invented the first microprocessor smart card with two chips : one microprocessor and one memory , and in 1978 , he patented the self - programmable one - chip microcomputer ( SPOM ) that defines the necessary architecture to program the chip . Three years later , Motorola used this patent in its `` CP8 '' . At that time , Bull had 1,200 patents related to smart cards . In 2001 , Bull sold its CP8 division together with its patents to Schlumberger , who subsequently combined its own internal smart card department and CP8 to create Axalto . In 2006 , Axalto and Gemplus , at the time the world 's top two smart - card manufacturers , merged and became Gemalto . In 2008 , Dexa Systems spun off from Schlumberger and acquired Enterprise Security Services business , which included the smart - card solutions division responsible for deploying the first large - scale smart - card management systems based on public key infrastructure ( PKI ) .",

An example of a limiting factor is sunlight in the rain forest , where growth is limited to all plants on the forest floor unless more light becomes available . This decreases a number of potential factors that could influence a biological process , but only one is in effect at any one place and time . This recognition that there is always a single limiting factor is vital in ecology ; and the concept has parallels in numerous other processes . The limiting factor also causes competition between individuals of a species population . For example , space is a limiting factor . Many predators and prey need a certain amount of space for survival : food , water , and other biological needs . If the population of a species is too high , they start competing for those needs . Thus the limiting factors hold down population in an area by causing some individuals to seek better prospects elsewhere and others to stay and starve . Some other limiting factors in biology include temperature and other weather related factors . Species can also be limited by the availability of macro - and micronutrients . There has even been evidence of co-limitation in prairie ecosystems . A study published in 2017 showed that sodium ( a micronutrient ) had no effect on its own , but when in combination with nitrogen and phosphorus ( macronutrients ) , it did show positive effects , which is evidence of serial co-limitation .",

These areas , known as the `` Arctic ring of life '' , have high biological productivity in comparison to the deep waters of the high Arctic . The polar bear tends to frequent areas where sea ice meets water , such as polynyas and leads ( temporary stretches of open water in Arctic ice ) , to hunt the seals that make up most of its diet . Freshwater is limited in these environments because it is either locked up in snow or saline . Polar bears are able to produce water through the metabolism of fats found in seal blubber .

Vendler believes that if the love the young man felt was real it would still be there after the object of that love 's beauty had long faded away , but he `` has announced the waning of his own attachment to the speaker , dissolving the `` marriage of true minds '' '' Shakespeare is arguing that if love is true it will stand against all tests of time and adversity , no manner of insignificant details such as the person 's beauty fading could alter or dissolve `` the marriage of two minds '' .",

            "sentence": "The exact field goal range varies for each team , depending on the ability of the team 's placekicker . While some weaker placekickers may have trouble kicking field goals longer than 30 yards ( making field goals from beyond the 13 difficult ) , others may consistently make 50 - yarders , making it practical to kick from beyond the 33 . For most NFL kickers , the 35 - yard line is typically the limit of their field goal range . Weather conditions , particularly wind , also have a significant impact on field goal range ; kicking with the wind at the kicker 's back significantly increases field goal range , while kicking against the wind or with a stiff crosswind will greatly reduce the kicker 's effective range , while generally there is no advantage beyond assured targeting of a kick if a game is being played indoors . Altitude also affects kicking range ; both the longest punt in NFL history and three of the longest field goals in NFL history took place in Denver , Colorado , which is more than 4,000 feet ( 1,200 m ) higher in elevation than the next - highest NFL city ( the Phoenix suburb of Glendale , Arizona ) . From the 1970s through the 1990s , artificial turf improved a kicker 's field goal range by having less friction during the kick ; one of the reasons Scott Norwood missed the game - winning kick in Super Bowl XXV was that he kicked on artificial turf in Buffalo and struggled with longer field goals on natural grass throughout his career , and Super Bowl XXV was played on a grass surface . ( Modern artificial turf , which has similar depth and characteristics to natural grass , does not have an appreciable effect on kicking range . )",

In the Bosom Buddies episode `` Only The Lonely '' , Ruth invites Kip and Henry to her apartment for a get - together , but keeps the party going until all hours and wo n't let the pair leave . When she starts singing the Banana Boat Song , Kip and Henry only join in on the chorus : `` We want to go home '' . The original 1956 Belafonte recording was heard in the 1988 film Beetlejuice in a dinner scene in which the guests are supernaturally compelled to dance along to the song by the film 's protagonists . Belafonte 's version was used in a 1990s ABC ident featuring the Bananas in Pyjamas . On the NFL Primetime program , Chris Berman uses the phrase `` Daylight come and you got ta Delhomme '' , as a nickname for former Carolina Panthers quarterback Jake Delhomme . In Ava DuVernay 's film Selma , Rev. Hosea Williams ( played by Wendell Pierce ) starts a chorus of the song at a meeting where it is announced that Harry Belafonte will join the final and successful third of the Selma to Montgomery marches . Belafonte appears among the marchers in newsreel footage shown during the end credits of the film . In Thomas & Friends Sodor 's Legend of the Lost Treasure , Skiff the Railboat ( Jamie Campbell Bower ) sings a part of the chorus after he sees the sun comes up , whilst calling Sailor John ( John Hurt ) out that it is time to go home . In Dancing with the Stars ( U.S. season 23 ) , Terra Jole and Sasha Farber danced to this song in the special `` Halloween Dance Night .

Although often debated , most scholars agree that modern human behavior can be characterized by abstract thinking , planning depth , symbolic behavior ( e.g. , art , ornamentation , music ) , exploitation of large game , and blade technology , among others . Underlying these behaviors and technological innovations are cognitive and cultural foundations that have been documented experimentally and ethnographically . Some of these human universal patterns are cumulative cultural adaptation , social norms , language , and extensive help and cooperation beyond close kin . It has been argued that the development of these modern behavioral traits , in combination with the climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum , was largely responsible for the human replacement of Neanderthals and the peopling of the rest of the world .",

The extent of the region being claimed was vague at first , evolving over decades into the specific borders specified in the US - British treaty of 1818 . The U.S. - based its claim in part on Robert Gray 's entry of the Columbia River in 1792 and the Lewis and Clark Expedition . Great Britain based its claim in part on British overland explorations of the Columbia River by David Thompson and on prior discovery and exploration along the Coast . Spain 's claim was based on the Inter caetera and Treaty of Tordesillas of 1493 -- 94 , as well as explorations of the Pacific coast in the late 18th century . Russia based its claim off its explorations and trading activities in the region and asserted its ownership of the region north of the 51st parallel by the Ukase of 1821 , which was quickly challenged by the other powers and withdrawn to 54 \u00b0 40 \u2032 N by separate treaties with the US and Britain in 1824 and 1825 respectively . Spain gave up its claims of exclusivity via the Nootka Conventions of the 1790s . In the Nootka Conventions , which followed the Nootka Crisis Spain granted Britain rights to the Pacific Northwest , although it did not establish a northern boundary for Spanish California , nor did it extinguish Spanish rights to the Pacific Northwest . Spain later relinquished any remaining claims to territory north of the 42nd parallel to the United States as part of the Adams - On\u00eds Treaty of 1819 . In the 1820s , Russia gave up its claims south of 54 \u00b0 40 \u2032 and east of the 141st meridian in separate treaties with the United States and Britain .",

            "sentence": "When Hitler 's power grew , the Freud family and many of their colleagues fled to London . Within a year Sigmund Freud died . In the United States , also following the death of Freud , a new group of psychoanalysts began to explore the function of the ego . Led by Heinz Hartmann , Kris , Rappaport and Lowenstein , the group built upon understandings of the synthetic function of the ego as a mediator in psychic functioning . Hartmann in particular distinguished between autonomous ego functions ( such as memory and intellect which could be secondarily affected by conflict ) and synthetic functions which were a result of compromise formation . These `` Ego Psychologists '' of the 1950s paved a way to focus analytic work by attending to the defenses ( mediated by the ego ) before exploring the deeper roots to the unconscious conflicts . In addition there was burgeoning interest in child psychoanalysis . Although criticized since its inception , psychoanalysis has been used as a research tool into childhood development , and is still used to treat certain mental disturbances . In the 1960s , Freud 's early thoughts on the childhood development of female sexuality were challenged ; this challenge led to the development of a variety of understandings of female sexual development , many of which modified the timing and normality of several of Freud 's theories ( which had been gleaned from the treatment of women with mental disturbances ) . Several researchers followed Karen Horney 's studies of societal pressures that influence the development of women .",

The writers wanted to create choices that would appear to have a significant impact on the story but ultimately would be mostly inconsequential to the larger story . At major decision points , the writers ' aim was try to have the audience split evenly by making the dialog as neutral as possible prior to the choice ; they considered that a split of 75 to 25 percent was not ideal . They noted such cases occurred in both the first episode , where the player has an option to save Carley ( the `` hot reporter with a gun '' ) or Doug ( the `` dorky dude '' ) , with the vast majority of players saving Carley , and in the second episode , where the player is given the option to cut off Parker 's leg before they are attacked by Walkers or leave him behind , with most players cutting off the leg .

            "sentence": "The Maryland Toleration Act , also known as the Act Concerning Religion , was a law mandating religious tolerance for Trinitarian Christians . It was passed on April 21 , 1649 , by the assembly of the Maryland colony , in St. Mary 's City . It was the second law requiring religious tolerance in the British North American colonies and created one of the pioneer statutes passed by the legislative body of an organized colonial government to guarantee any degree of religious liberty . Specifically , the bill , now usually referred to as the Toleration Act , granted freedom of conscience to all Christians . ( The colony which became Rhode Island passed a series of laws , the first in 1636 , which prohibited religious persecution including against non-Trinitarians ; Rhode Island was also the first government to separate church and state . ) Historians argue that it helped inspire later legal protections for freedom of religion in the United States . The Calvert family , who founded Maryland partly as a refuge for English Catholics , sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and those of other religions that did not conform to the dominant Anglicanism of Britain and her colonies .",

Chatsworth was again used for exterior , and some interior , scenes for the BBC adaptation of Death Comes to Pemberley . Harewood House , near Leeds in West Yorkshire , was the setting for Pemberley in the ITV fantasy series Lost in Austen . This series was not a direct adaptation of the novel , but the novel provided the majority of the plots , characters and inspiration . Some interior scenes in the BBC adaptation of Death Comes to Pemberley were filmed at Harewood . Pemberley Press is the name of the publishing house that Bridget Jones works at in the 2001 film Bridget Jones 's Diary , in homage to Pride and Prejudice . In The Lizzie Bennet Diaries , a vlog - style modern adaptation of Pride and Prejudice , Pemberley Digital is the name of Darcy 's company . Darcy says Pemberley is the name of the place that his father 's family comes from in England .",

Trailing by a score of 6 - 1 , Lance Berkman hit an eighth inning grand slam to narrow the score to 6 -- 5 . In the bottom of the ninth , catcher Brad Ausmus , hit a game tying home run that allowed the game to continue in extra innings . In the bottom of the tenth inning , Luke Scott hit a blast to left field that had home run distance , but was inches foul . This game remained scoreless for the next eight innings . In the top of the fifteenth inning , Roger Clemens made only his second career relief appearance , pitching three shutout innings , notably striking out Julio Franco , at the time the oldest player in the MLB at 47 years old ; Clemens was himself 43 . In the bottom of the eighteenth inning , Clemens came to bat again , indicating that he would be pitching in the nineteenth inning , if it came to that . Clemens struck out , but the next batter , Chris Burke , hit a home run to left field for the Astros win , 7 -- 6 . Oddly enough , a fan in the `` Crawford Boxes '' in left field had previously caught Berkman 's grand slam and this same fan caught Burke 's home run . The National League Championship Series featured a rematch of the 2004 NLCS . The Astros lost the first game in St. Louis , but would win the next three games , with Roy Oswalt getting the win . Though the Astros were poised to close out the series in Game Five in Houston , Brad Lidge gave up a monstrous two - out three - run home run to Albert Pujols , forcing the series to a sixth game in St. Louis , where the Astros clinched a World Series appearance . Roy Oswalt was named NLCS MVP , having gone 2 -- 0 with a 1.29 ERA in the series . Current honorary NL President William Y. Giles presented the league champion Astros with the Warren C.

            "sentence": "The new style was also encouraged by changes in the economic order and social structure . As the 18th century progressed , the nobility became the primary patrons of instrumental music , while public taste increasingly preferred lighter , funny comic operas . This led to changes in the way music was performed , the most crucial of which was the move to standard instrumental groups and the reduction in the importance of the continuo -- the rhythmic and harmonic groundwork of a piece of music , typically played by a keyboard ( harpsichord or organ ) and usually accompanied by a varied group of bass instruments , including cello , double bass , bass viol , and theorbo . One way to trace the decline of the continuo and its figured chords is to examine the disappearance of the term obbligato , meaning a mandatory instrumental part in a work of chamber music . In Baroque compositions , additional instruments could be added to the continuo group according to the group or leader 's preference ; in Classical compositions , all parts were specifically noted , though not always notated , so the term `` obbligato '' became redundant . By 1800 , basso continuo was practically extinct , except for the occasional use of a pipe organ continuo part in a religious Mass in the early 1800s .",

The end of convict transportation accelerated reform in the 1840s and 1850s . The Australian Colonies Government Act ( 1850 ) was a landmark development which granted representative constitutions to New South Wales , Victoria , South Australia and Tasmania and the colonies enthusiastically set about writing constitutions which produced democratically progressive parliaments -- though the constitutions generally maintained the role of the colonial upper houses as representative of social and economic `` interests '' and all established constitutional monarchies with the British monarch as the symbolic head of state .",

Later , this behavior appeared to be an artifact of intrusive laboratory observation . Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial . Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field , such as bright lights or moving scientists . Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum ( so that they were not hungry ) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed .

The cultured Greek language of the Epistle , it is contended , could not have been written by a Jerusalem Jew . Some scholars argue for a primitive version of the letter composed by James and then later polished by another writer . The epistle was only gradually accepted into the canon of the New Testament . Some see parallels between James and 1 Peter , 1 Clement , and the Shepherd of Hermas and take this to reflect the socio - economic situation Christians were dealing with in the late 1st or early 2nd century . It thus could have been written anywhere in the Empire that Christians spoke Greek . There are some scholars who argued for Syria .",

In primates , dopaminergic neuron activity increases in the nigrostriatal pathway when a new stimulus is presented . Dopaminergic activity decreases with repeated stimulus presentation . However , behaviorally significant stimulus presentation ( i.e. rewards ) continues to activate dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta . Dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area ( bottom part of the `` midbrain '' or mesencephalon ) to the prefrontal cortex ( mesocortical pathway ) and to the nucleus accumbens ( mesolimbic pathway - `` meso '' referring to `` from the mesencephalon '' ... specifically the ventral tegmental area ) are implicated in reward , pleasure , and addictive behavior . The pars compacta is also important in spatial learning , the observations about one 's environment and location in space . Lesions in the pars compacta lead to learning deficits in repeating identical movements , and some studies point to its involvement in a dorsal striatal - dependent , response - based memory system that functions relatively independent of the hippocampus , which is traditionally believed to subserve spatial or episodic - like memory functions .",

The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls , accompanied by a wide area ( later known as the `` death strip '' ) that contained anti-vehicle trenches , `` fakir beds '' and other defenses . The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the `` will of the people '' in building a socialist state in East Germany .

Composers such as Debussy and Strauss found differing ways of stretching the limits of the tonal system in order to accommodate their ideas . After a brief period of free atonality , Arnold Schoenberg and others began exploring tone rows , in which an ordering of the twelve pitches of the equal tempered chromatic scale is used as the source material of a composition .

The money provides funding for operations , personnel , equipment , and activities . Regular appropriations bills are passed annually , with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year . The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government , which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year . When Congress and the president fail to agree on and pass one or more of the regular appropriations bills , a continuing resolution can be passed instead . A continuing resolution continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year ( or with minor modifications ) for a set amount of time . Continuing resolutions typically provide funding at a rate or formula based on the previous year 's funding . The funding extends until a specific date or regular appropriations bills are passed , whichever comes first . There can be some changes to some of the accounts in a continuing resolution .

The station being built near the Forest Moon of Endor like the second Death Star before it is similar to an original concept for Return of the Jedi , where two Death Stars would have been built near Had Abbadon ( then the Imperial capital world ) . The Habitation spheres , based on the Imperials ' suspicious claims that they were designed strictly for peaceful purposes , were suggested by some fans to have been the origin for the Death Star III .

This causes the plant to have elongated cells on the farthest side from the light . Phototropism is one of the many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli . Growth towards a light source is called positive phototropism , while growth away from light is called negative phototropism ( skototropism ) . Most plant shoots exhibit positive phototropism , and rearrange their chloroplasts in the leaves to maximize photosynthetic energy and promote growth . Roots usually exhibit negative phototropism , although gravitropism may play a larger role in root behavior and growth .

Common miscolours in the Australian Cattle Dog are black hairs in a red - coated dog , including the extreme of a black saddle on a red dog , and extensive tan on the face and body on a blue dog , called `` creeping tan '' . The Cattle Dog has a double coat -- the short , straight outer guard hairs are protective in nature , keeping the elements from the dog 's skin while the undercoat is short , fine and dense .",

Everest himself opposed the name suggested by Waugh and told the Royal Geographical Society in 1857 that `` Everest '' could not be written in Hindi nor pronounced by `` the native of India '' . Waugh 's proposed name prevailed despite the objections , and in 1865 , the Royal Geographical Society officially adopted Mount Everest as the name for the highest mountain in the world . The modern pronunciation of Everest ( / \u02c8\u025bv ( \u0259 ) r\u026ast / ) is different from Sir George 's pronunciation of his surname ( / \u02c8i\u02d0vr\u026ast / EEV - rist ) .",

This early revolutionary group was swelled by a large number of urban workers . The following day , the revolutionaries began flying their own flag , clearly influenced by that of the Brabant Revolution of 1789 . To maintain order , several bourgeois militia groups were formed . The situation in Brussels led to widespread unrest across the country . King William I rejected his son 's advice to negotiate with the rebels , forcing them towards a more radical , pro-independence stance , and sent a large military force to Brussels to suppress the insurrection .",

            "sentence": "The head of state appoints a prime minister who will likely have majority support in parliament . While in practice most prime ministers under the Westminster system ( including Australia , Canada , India , New Zealand and the United Kingdom ) are the leaders of the largest party in parliament , technically the appointment of the prime minister is a prerogative exercised by the monarch , the governor - general , or the president . No parliamentary vote takes place on who is forming a government , but since parliament can immediately defeat the government with a motion of no confidence , the head of state is limited by convention to choosing a candidate who can command the confidence of parliament , and thus has little or no influence in the decision . The head of state appoints a prime minister who must gain a vote of confidence within a set time . Examples : Italy , Thailand . The head of state appoints the leader of the political party holding a plurality of seats in parliament as prime minister . For example , in Greece if no party has a majority , the leader of the party with a plurality of seats is given an exploratory mandate to receive the confidence of the parliament within three days . If this is not possible , then the leader of the party with the second highest seat number is given the exploratory mandate . If this fails , then the leader of the third largest party is given it and so on . The head of state nominates a candidate for prime minister who is then submitted to parliament for approval before appointment . Example : Spain , where the King sends a nomination to parliament for approval . Also , Germany where under the German Basic Law ( constitution ) the Bundestag votes on a candidate nominated by the federal president . In these cases , parliament can choose another candidate who then would be appointed by the head of state . Parliament nominates a candidate whom the head of state is constitutionally obliged to appoint as prime minister . Example : Japan , where the Emperor appoints the Prime Minister on the nomination of the Diet . Also , Ireland where the President of Ireland appoints the Taoiseach on the nomination of the D\u00e1il . A public officeholder ( other than the head of state or their representative ) nominates a candidate , who , if approved by parliament , is appointed as prime minister . Example : Under the Swedish Instrument of Government ( 1974 ) , the power to appoint someone to form a government has been moved from the monarch to the Speaker of Parliament and the parliament itself . The speaker nominates a candidate , who is then elected to prime minister ( statsminister ) by the parliament if an absolute majority of the members of parliament does not vote no ( i.e. he can be elected even if more members of parliament vote No than Yes ) . Direct election by popular vote . Example : Israel , 1996 -- 2001 , where the prime minister was elected in a general election , with no regard to political affiliation , and whose procedure can also be described as of a semi-parliamentary system .",

The emerging economic and financial power of Indian business - owners and merchants and the professional class brought them increasingly into conflict with the British Raj . A rising political consciousness among the native Indian social elite ( including lawyers , doctors , university graduates , government officials and similar groups ) spawned an Indian identity and fed a growing nationalist sentiment in India in the last decades of the nineteenth century . The creation in 1885 of the Indian National Congress in India by the political reformer A.O. Hume intensified the process by providing an important platform from which demands could be made for political liberalisation , increased autonomy , and social reform . The leaders of the Congress advocated dialogue and debate with the Raj administration to achieve their political goals . Distinct from these moderate voices ( or loyalists ) who did not preach or support violence was the nationalist movement , which grew particularly strong , radical and violent in Bengal and in Punjab . Notable but smaller movements also appeared in Maharashtra , Madras and other areas across the south .",

In 1903 , the British sportswriter Henry Chadwick published an article speculating that baseball derived from a British game called rounders , which Chadwick had played as a boy in England . But baseball executive Albert Spalding disagreed . Baseball , said Spalding , was fundamentally an American sport and began on American soil . To settle the matter , the two men appointed a commission , headed by Abraham Mills , the fourth president of the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs . The commission , which also included six other sports executives , labored for three years , after which it declared that Abner Doubleday invented the national pastime . This would have been a surprise to Doubleday . The late Civil War hero `` never knew that he had invented baseball '' . ( But ) 15 years ( after his death ) , he was anointed as the father of the game `` , writes baseball historian John Thorn . The myth about Doubleday inventing the game of baseball actually came from a Colorado mining engineer .

Storks were also thought to care for their aged parents , feeding them and even transporting them , and children 's books depicted them as a model of filial values . A Greek law called Pelargonia , from the Ancient Greek word pelargos for stork , required citizens to take care of their aged parents . The Greeks also held that killing a stork could be punished with death . It was allegedly protected in Ancient Thessaly as it hunted snakes , and widely held to be Virgil 's `` white bird '' .

During hemostasis three steps occur in a rapid sequence . Vascular spasm is the first response as the blood vessels constrict to allow less blood to be lost . In the second step , platelet plug formation , platelets stick together to form a temporary seal to cover the break in the vessel wall . The third and last step is called coagulation or blood clotting . Coagulation reinforces the platelet plug with fibrin threads that act as a `` molecular glue '' . Platelets are a large factor in the hemostatic process . They allow for the creation of the `` platelet plug '' that forms almost directly after a blood vessel has been ruptured . Within seconds of a blood vessel 's epithelial wall being disrupted platelets begin to adhere to the sub-endothelium surface . It takes approximately sixty seconds until the first fibrin strands begin to intersperse among the wound . After several minutes the platelet plug is completely formed by fibrin .

As the music progresses , the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale . Music can be transposed from one scale to another for various purposes , often to accommodate the range of a vocalist . Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range , but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale . For example , transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a whole tone . Since the interval relationships remain unchanged , transposition may be unnoticed by a listener , however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch range compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music .

Each is defined as either a mass of alcohol per volume of blood or a mass of alcohol per mass of blood ( never a volume per volume ) . 1 milliliter of blood has a mass of approximately 1.06 grams . Because of this , units by volume are similar but not identical to units by mass . In the U.S. the concentration unit 1 % w / v ( percent mass / volume , equivalent to 10 g / l or 1 g per 100 ml ) is in use . This is not to be confused with the amount of alcohol measured on the breath , as with a breathalyzer . The amount of alcohol measured on the breath is generally accepted as proportional to the amount of alcohol present in the blood at a rate of 1 : 2100 . Therefore , a breathalyzer measurement of 0.10 mg / L of breath alcohol converts to 0.0001 \u00d7 2100 g / 10dL , or 0.021 g / dL of blood alcohol ( the units of the BAC in the United States ) .

It is uncertain as to who said it there , since various histories , including eyewitness accounts , attribute it to Putnam , Stark , Prescott , or Gridley , and it may have been said first by one , and repeated by the others . It was also not an original statement . The idea dates originally to the general - king Gustavus Adolphus ( 1594 -- 1632 ) who gave standing orders to his musketeers : `` never to give fire , till they could see their own image in the pupil of their enemy 's eye '' . Gustavus Adolphus 's military teachings were widely admired and imitated and caused this saying to be often repeated . It was used by General James Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham , when his troops defeated Montcalm 's army on September 13 , 1759 . The earliest similar quote came from the Battle of Dettingen on June 27 , 1743 , where Lieutenant - Colonel Sir Andrew Agnew of Lochnaw warned his Regiment , the Royal Scots Fusiliers , not to fire until they could `` see the white of their e'en . '' The phrase was also used by Prince Charles of Prussia in 1745 , and repeated in 1755 by Frederick the Great , and may have been mentioned in histories the colonial military leaders were familiar with . Whether or not it was actually said in this battle , it was clear that the colonial military leadership were regularly reminding their troops to hold their fire until the moment when it would have the greatest effect , especially in situations where their ammunition would be limited .",

Her mother died when she was five years old . Her catchphrases during the early seasons of the series include `` how rude ! , '' `` well , pin a rose on your nose ! '' and `` hot dog '' . She eventually evolved into something of a tomboy in seasons four and five . Stephanie has a habit of spying on D.J. 's life by reading her diary and eavesdropping on her telephone calls ( having been caught in the act several times ) , and is generally the most athletic and nosiest of the Tanner girls . Her best friends in school are Gia Mahan and Mickey , whom she meets in season seven ( the former is the only one who appears through to season eight ) . Of the three sisters , Stephanie has dealt with the toughest issues , such as peer pressure into smoking ( in season seven 's `` Fast Friends '' ) , `` make - out '' parties ( in season eight 's `` Making Out is Hard to Do '' ) , joyriding ( in season eight 's `` Stephanie 's Wild Ride '' ) , and uncovering a classmate 's child abuse ( in season six 's `` Silence is Not Golden '' ) , as well as the death of her mother when she was only five . In her early years , she is very sentimental about Mr. Bear , a stuffed animal that her mother gave to her after Michelle was born ( this was the focal point of the season two episode `` Goodbye Mr. Bear '' ) . She and Jesse are the most abrasive when it comes to how they feel about Kimmy Gibbler .",

            "sentence": "In 1958 , on the eve of neighboring Somalia 's independence in 1960 , a referendum was held in the territory to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France . The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France , partly due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans . There was also reports of widespread vote rigging , with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls . The majority of those who voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia , as had been proposed by Mahmoud Harbi , Vice President of the Government Council . Harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later . Djibouti finally gained its independence from France in 1977 , and Hassan Gouled Aptidon , a Somali politician who had campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958 , eventually wound up as the nation 's first president ( 1977 -- 1999 ) . In early 2011 , the Djiboutian citizenry took part in a series of protests against the long - serving government , which were associated with the larger Arab Spring demonstrations . The unrest eventually subsided by April of the year , and Djibouti 's ruling People 's Rally for Progress party was re-elected to office .",

Its construction started in 1357 under the auspices of King Charles IV , and finished in the beginning of the 15th century . The bridge replaced the old Judith Bridge built 1158 -- 1172 that had been badly damaged by a flood in 1342 . This new bridge was originally called Stone Bridge ( Kamenn\u00fd most ) or Prague Bridge ( Pra\u017esk\u00fd most ) but has been `` Charles Bridge '' since 1870 . As the only means of crossing the river Vltava ( Moldau ) until 1841 , Charles Bridge was the most important connection between Prague Castle and the city 's Old Town and adjacent areas . This `` solid - land '' connection made Prague important as a trade route between Eastern and Western Europe .",

Olivia 's father Martin Olson was an acquaintance of Ward , and Olivia was encouraged to audition for Adventure Time after Ward told her father that he wanted `` her as a voice '' on his show . She had originally auditioned for the role of Princess Bubblegum . After her initial audition , she was asked to read for the role of Marceline , and was `` definitely impressed by the character '' after seeing design drawings . Martin Olson later noted that Olivia 's audition was a `` sham '' to please the network executives because Ward had already wanted her to be a voice on the show . In order to get into character , Olson often dresses in a manner similar to Marceline when she records her lines ; she explained , `` I always find ... that on the days that I go in to record Marceline , I 'll dress like her , in a weird way ... I 'll throw on some rock n ' roll boots , maybe some red lipstick , and just go in there . '' Olson also is the character 's singing voice . According to storyboard artist Cole Sanchez , composers Casey James Basichis and Tim Kiefer produce the bass music that the character performs in the series . Many of the songs written for Marceline were uploaded onto the internet by the writers as well as the production company . For instance , Rob Sugar -- the father of former storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar -- often uploaded demos of songs written for Marceline by Rebecca . Furthermore , Frederator also posted demos , as well as a full version of the popular `` Fry Song '' , sung by Marceline in the episode `` It Came from the Nightosphere '' , on its official blog . In flashback sequences , younger Marceline is voiced by Ava Acres . In the fifth season episodes `` Finn the Human '' / `` Jake the Dog '' , an older , alternate universe version of the character is voiced by Cloris Leachman . Martin Olson also provides the voice for Marceline 's demonic father Hunson Abadeer . Olivia Olson later noted that the opportunity to voice act with her father was `` pretty cool '' .",

Monahan ( 1941 ) studied social workers who were accustomed to interacting with a diverse range of people and found that the majority experienced difficulty when asked to consider that a beautiful person was guilty of a crime . A study presented two hypothetical crimes : a burglary and a swindle . The burglary involved a woman illegally obtaining a key and stealing $2,200 ; the swindle involved a woman manipulating a man to invest $2,200 in a nonexistent corporation . The results showed that when the offense was not related to attractiveness ( as in the burglary ) the unattractive defendant was punished more severely than the attractive one . However , when the offense was related to attractiveness ( the swindle ) , the attractive defendant was punished more severely than the unattractive one .

Livingston of New York , and Roger Sherman of Connecticut . The committee left no minutes , so there is some uncertainty about how the drafting process proceeded ; contradictory accounts were written many years later by Jefferson and Adams , too many years to be regarded as entirely reliable -- although their accounts are frequently cited . What is certain is that the committee discussed the general outline which the document should follow and decided that Jefferson would write the first draft . The committee in general , and Jefferson in particular , thought that Adams should write the document , but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson and promised to consult with him personally . Considering Congress 's busy schedule , Jefferson probably had limited time for writing over the next seventeen days , and likely wrote the draft quickly . He then consulted the others and made some changes , and then produced another copy incorporating these alterations . The committee presented this copy to the Congress on June 28 , 1776 .

At the time , mascots were generally animals brought into the stadium or arena . A buck deer was contemplated but rejected as impossible . Instead , the buckeye was selected , as the buckeye is the official state tree of Ohio . A simple papier - m\u00e2ch\u00e9 nut was constructed by students , worn over the head and torso , with legs sticking out . It made its appearance at the Minnesota vs. Ohio State homecoming football game on October 30 , 1965 . The heavy papier - m\u00e2ch\u00e9 nut did not last and it was soon replaced by a fiberglass shell . On November 21 , 1965 , The Columbus Dispatch reported that judges picked Brutus Buckeye to be the new mascot 's name after a campus - wide `` Name the Buckeye '' contest . The winning name was the idea of then Ohio State student Kerry J. Reed , 21 . `` Block O '' agreed to care for Brutus in December . In the early 2000s , the Brutus costume was stolen before a game . The mascot was forced to wear the old costume .",
