Strengths is the longest word in the English language containing only one vowel .

However , the `` word '' itself is simply a mnemonic consisting of the vowels to be sung in the phrase `` seculorum Amen '' at the end of the lesser doxology . ( Although u was often used interchangeably with v , and the variant `` Evovae '' is occasionally used , the v in these cases would still be a vowel . ) The longest words with no repeated letters are dermatoglyphics , misconjugatedly and uncopyrightables . The longest word whose letters are in alphabetical order is the eight - letter Aegilops , a grass genus . However , this is arguably both Latin and a proper noun . There are several six - letter English words with their letters in alphabetical order , including abhors , almost , begins , biopsy , chimps and chintz .

There was a sudden and unexpected power surge . When operators attempted an emergency shutdown , a much larger spike in power output occurred . This second spike led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions . These events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air , causing it to ignite . For the next week , the resulting fire sent long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area , including Pripyat . The plumes drifted over large parts of the western Soviet Union and Europe . According to official post-Soviet data , about 60 % of the fallout landed in Belarus .",

            "sentence": "Motion control -- for some applications , such as simple pick - and - place assembly , the robot need merely return repeatably to a limited number of pre-taught positions . For more sophisticated applications , such as welding and finishing ( spray painting ) , motion must be continuously controlled to follow a path in space , with controlled orientation and velocity . Power source -- some robots use electric motors , others use hydraulic actuators . The former are faster , the latter are stronger and advantageous in applications such as spray painting , where a spark could set off an explosion ; however , low internal air - pressurisation of the arm can prevent ingress of flammable vapours as well as other contaminants . Drive -- some robots connect electric motors to the joints via gears ; others connect the motor to the joint directly ( direct drive ) . Using gears results in measurable ' backlash ' which is free movement in an axis . Smaller robot arms frequently employ high speed , low torque DC motors , which generally require high gearing ratios ; this has the disadvantage of backlash . In such cases the harmonic drive is often used . Compliance - this is a measure of the amount in angle or distance that a robot axis will move when a force is applied to it . Because of compliance when a robot goes to a position carrying its maximum payload it will be at a position slightly lower than when it is carrying no payload . Compliance can also be responsible for overshoot when carrying high payloads in which case acceleration would need to be reduced .",

            "sentence": "The crust ranges from 5 -- 70 kilometres ( 3.1 -- 43.5 mi ) in depth and is the outermost layer . The thin parts are the oceanic crust , which underlie the ocean basins ( 5 -- 10 km ) and are composed of dense ( mafic ) iron magnesium silicate igneous rocks , like basalt . The thicker crust is continental crust , which is less dense and composed of ( felsic ) sodium potassium aluminium silicate rocks , like granite . The rocks of the crust fall into two major categories -- sial and sima ( Suess , 1831 -- 1914 ) . It is estimated that sima starts about 11 km below the Conrad discontinuity ( a second order discontinuity ) . The uppermost mantle together with the crust constitutes the lithosphere . The crust - mantle boundary occurs as two physically different events . First , there is a discontinuity in the seismic velocity , which is most commonly known as the Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity or Moho . The cause of the Moho is thought to be a change in rock composition from rocks containing plagioclase feldspar ( above ) to rocks that contain no feldspars ( below ) . Second , in oceanic crust , there is a chemical discontinuity between ultramafic cumulates and tectonized harzburgites , which has been observed from deep parts of the oceanic crust that have been obducted onto the continental crust and preserved as ophiolite sequences .",

None of these proofs were without fault however ( for example , Clairaut assumed all definite integrals could be differentiated under the integral sign ) . In 1867 Ernst Leonard Lindel\u00f6f published a paper criticizing in detail all the proofs he was familiar with . Finally , six year later Hermann Schwarz ( 1873 ) gave the first satisfactory proof . This was followed by successive refinements that relaxed the hypotheses in Schwarz 's theorem in various ways , among others by Dini , Jordan , Peano , E.W. Hobson , W.H. Young .

Base voters are very unlikely to vote for the candidate of an opposing party , regardless of the specific views each candidate holds . In the United States , this is typically because high - level candidates must hold the same stances on key issues as a party 's base in order to gain the party 's nomination and thus be guaranteed ballot access . In the case of legislative elections , base voters often prefer to support their party 's candidate against an otherwise appealing opponent in order to strengthen their party 's chances of gaining a simple majority ; typically the gateway to overarching power in a legislature .",

That is to say that if a person 's data were in a database , that person 's attributes , such as their address , phone number , and age , were now considered to belong to that person instead of being extraneous data . This allows for relations between data to be relations to objects and their attributes and not to individual fields . The term `` object - relational impedance mismatch '' described the inconvenience of translating between programmed objects and database tables . Object databases and object - relational databases attempt to solve this problem by providing an object - oriented language ( sometimes as extensions to SQL ) that programmers can use as alternative to purely relational SQL .

            "sentence": "In an attempt to revive Wittgenstein to his superior state , Radio and Ratso go to the college 's storage building to find the hard - to - find WFC 11 - 12 - 55 tube . When they come back with the last apparent tube for miles , however , Radio and Ratso ( after an argument with the tube ) accidentally break it , and it seems that all hope is lost . Wittgenstein does his best with all his might , but the virus causes him to blow his remaining tube with a big explosion and apparently `` is a goner '' . Ratso then blames Radio , and guilt - ridden over condemning the animals to their doom at Tartarus Laboratories , Radio gives up his own tube which turns out to be the very rare tube they had been looking for , thus killing himself . Knowing that they were given a final chance to save the animals , the appliances replaced the tube in the nick of time . With the boosted power of the new tube , Wittgenstein wakes up , miraculously regenerates the other smashed tubes connected to himself , and destroys the computer viruses within him , allowing him to be completely revived to as good as new . By the end of the film , the appliances restore Rob 's thesis and stop Mack from selling the injured animals and have him arrested with some help from Wittgenstein , Rob and his girlfriend Chris ( later referred to as `` The Mistress '' ) , two guard dogs , and the police . After discovering the appliances in the truck , they assume that Mac had also planned to sell Rob 's stuff as well , although Rob is surprised that Radio is n't here . Later , they discover Wittgenstein in the basement along with Radio . Later , Radio 's tube is replaced with a new one Chris found in Nome , Alaska ( hence his revival ) , Wittgenstein is sold to a museum and will be modernized with current technology , Rob proposes to Chris , and all is well .",

Now in his middle age , he 's a richer , nuanced singer than he was during Oasis 's heyday , yet he 's retained his charisma and , unlike his brother , he favors color and fire in his records , elements that not only enhance this fine collection of songs but make this the best post-Oasis album from either Gallagher to date .

They generate electricity through a double sulfate chemical reaction . Lead and lead dioxide , the active materials on the battery 's plates , react with sulfuric acid in the electrolyte to form lead sulfate . The lead sulfate first forms in a finely divided , amorphous state , and easily reverts to lead , lead dioxide and sulfuric acid when the battery recharges . As batteries cycle through numerous discharges and charges , some lead sulfate is not recombined into electrolyte and slowly converts to a stable crystalline form that no longer dissolves on recharging .

            "sentence": "The offensive team may attempt to kick the ball through the goalposts , in the same manner that a field goal is kicked . If successful , the team is awarded one point , referred to as an extra point . This option is almost always chosen , because a two - point conversion attempt is much riskier . Since the extra point is almost always successful ( especially in NFL play ) , sportscasters will often refer to a team up or trailing by seven ( not six ) points as being `` up / trailing by a touchdown '' . The offensive team may attempt to advance the ball via run or pass into the end zone , much like a touchdown on the extra-point attempt , except that it receives two points . This is called a two - point conversion . The success rate for two - point conversions is about 48 percent in the NFL , making the two - point conversion attempt a risky tactic ; thus it is usually attempted only when two points will help the team but one point will not . For example , suppose that it is late in the game with a score of 21 -- 10 and the losing team scores a touchdown , making the score 21 -- 16 . The scoring team will usually attempt the two - point conversion , because if successful , a three - point deficit later could be matched with one field goal ; failure to convert would result in a five - point deficit that could be surmounted with another touchdown -- a situation no worse than the four - point deficit achieved with a kicked extra point . Another example would be if a team scores a late - game touchdown , and as a result is down by two points . A successful two - point conversion would tie the game , and likely force overtime . In very rare and risky instances , a trailing team who scored a touchdown , and as a result is down by 1 point , may attempt a two - point conversion to gamble on a win and avoid overtime ( or , under NCAA or NFHS rules , a subsequent overtime period ) . Two famous examples of this gamble were by Nebraska in the last minute of the 1984 Orange Bowl ( unsuccessful ) and by Boise State in the first overtime of the 2007 Fiesta Bowl ( successful ) . Note that under NCAA rules , teams are required to `` go for two '' starting with the third overtime procedure . Under college and NFL rules , if the defensive team gains possession and advances the ball the length of the field into the opposite end zone on the try ( for example by an interception or a fumble recovery , or by blocking a kick and legally recovering the ball ) , they score two points . This is officially recorded as a touchdown scored by the defense . The NCAA adopted this rule in 1988 ; the NFL added this in 2015 . This scenario can not occur under high school football rules ; the ball is ruled dead and the try is over immediately when the defense gains possession . In the extremely rare event that the offensive team scores a safety on the try , it receives one point . In college football , this can occur when , for example , the defense gains control of the ball and attempts to advance it , then fumbles it out of bounds in its own end zone . Prior to 2015 , only the offense could score a one - point safety in the NFL as the try ended once the defense gains possession . As of 2015 , either team may score a 1 - point safety due to the rule changes permitting the defense to return a try after a turnover . The game clock is not advanced during a try , however , the play clock is enforced . A delay of game penalty , false start , or similar penalty , by the offense results in a 5 - yard penalty assessed for the try . Typically , penalties charged against the defense give the offensive two options : half the distance to the goal for the try , or assessing the full penalty on the ensuing kickoff . Since the try is not timed by the game clock , if a touchdown is scored as regulation time expires ( and game clock subsequently reads 0 : 00.0 ) , the try is still allowed to be conducted . This instance is relatively common as teams score a game - tying ( or game - winning ) extra point after regulation has expired . During sudden - death overtime , particularly in the NFL , if a team scores a touchdown in the overtime period , the game is immediately over , and the try is not attempted . In NCAA overtime , if the second team to possess the ball in the overtime scores a touchdown which puts them ahead of the opponent in points the game ends immediately and no try is attempted . The officials ' signal for a successful try , whether an extra point or a two - point conversion , is the same as for a touchdown . After the try , the team that scored the touchdown kicks off to the opposing team .",

            "sentence": "In June 1980 , hostage Gail Kinchin and her unborn baby were killed in crossfire between West Midlands officers and her boyfriend . On 24 August 1985 John Shorthouse aged 5 was shot dead in a police raid on his home in Birmingham . The incident produced hostility towards the police over two days after John 's death when a policewoman was dragged from her patrol car and beaten by youths . Following the Shorthouse case , West Midlands police abandoned its practice of training rank - and - file officers for firearms duties and formed a specialist squad . On 24 April 1995 James Brady , 21 , was shot dead in an ambush by police officers acting on a tip - off . He and three friends were thought to be about to steal from a club in Westerhope village , near Newcastle . The torch he had been carrying was mistaken for a firearm . On 28 April 1995 A prisoner on day release , David Ewin , 38 , was shot twice in the stomach by a police officer after he was spotted in a stolen sports car in Barnes , west London . He died in hospital three weeks later . On 23 September 1996 Diarmuid O'Neill , 27 , a suspected IRA terrorist was hit and killed by 10 bullets when officers raided his lodgings in Hammersmith , west London . A February 2000 inquest ruled that the unarmed man was lawfully killed . On 20 November 1996 David Howell , 40 , a mental health patient , was shot dead by police marksmen when he ran amok with a knife in a Birmingham shop and took the manager hostage . An inquest jury later returned a verdict of lawful killing . On 15 January 1998 James Ashley , 39 , was shot and killed by Sussex Police while naked and unarmed during a drugs raid at his flat . The officer who fired the shots was cleared of any wrongdoing after a trial at the Old Bailey . On 26 February 1998 Michael Fitzgerald , 32 , was shot in the chest by police in Bedford after a two - hour stand - off . Neighbours had mistaken him for a burglar . It later emerged that he was in his own home and carrying a fake gun . On 10 April 1999 Devon and Cornwall police fatally shot Antony Kitts in Falmouth . He was reported to have threatened officers with what they thought was a sniper rifle . It turned out to be an air rifle . An inquest in 2000 returned a verdict of lawful killing . In June 1999 Derek Bateman , 47 , of Surrey was shot by a single bullet through the heart after his girlfriend went to a neighbour 's house and telephoned the police , telling them he was armed and had been threatening to shoot her . It was later determined that the weapon he had brandished at the police was an air pistol . On 22 September 1999 Harry Stanley , a painter and decorator , born in Bellshill near Glasgow , was walking home when he was shot dead by two Metropolitan Police officers following an erroneous report that he was carrying a sawn - off shotgun in a plastic bag . The officers challenged Mr Stanley from behind . As he turned to face them they shot him dead at a distance of 5 metres . It later emerged that the plastic bag actually contained a broken table leg that Stanley 's brother had just fixed for him . Following numerous enquiries ( in November 2004 a jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing ) both officers were exonerated after 6 years of court cases and inquiries . It was found that neither officer was liable for criminal charges nor would face any disciplinary sanctions . However , the report did make notable recommendations to the police on the post-incident procedure to be followed after a shooting and about challenging members of the public from behind . On 24 September 2000 Kirk Davies , 30 , died after being shot by a West Yorkshire police officer in Wakefield . He had an air rifle and had threatened a police officer earlier in the evening . On 30 October 2000 Patrick O'Donnell , 19 , was shot by a Metropolitan police officer after a siege at a house in Islington , north London , in which he took his mother and girlfriend hostage . On 12 July 2001 Mr Andrew Kernan , 37 , a gardener from Wavertree in Liverpool was shot dead in the street by the second of two shots fired by officers of the Merseyside Police Force . The officers had been called to the scene by the victim 's mother , Marie Kernan , who had also requested a psychiatric medical team attend her home because her schizophrenic son , Andrew Kernan , was being aggressive . At least four police officers from the Merseyside force went to Mrs Kernan 's flat but Andrew Kernan ran into the street , dressed in his pyjamas , wielding a Katana . Mr Kernan slashed off the wing mirror of one of the police cars . After negotiating with him for 25 minutes and using CS gas , officers fired two shots . The second bullet hit Mr Kernan in the chest and he died on the way to hospital . In the case of Andrew Kernan , the Chief Constable of Merseyside Police Norman Bettison took the unusual step of sending a hand - written letter to Marie Kernan with his apologies . The then Home Secretary David Blunkett ordered a review of how armed police were used , and the dead man 's mother , Marie Kernan , 59 , commented at the time : `` You do n't kill somebody with a mental illness . I demand justice for Andrew and wo n't rest until I get an answer . '' However , a verdict of lawful killing was returned by the jury at Liverpool District Coroner 's Court on 9 December 2004 , and the Coroner , Andre Rebello , praised the actions of the officers at the scene . The IPCA Commissioner for the North West , Mike Franklin , stated that `` the officers involved in this case were presented with a rapidly evolving scenario ... Firearms officers at the scene acted bravely and the investigation has found no evidence that their actions fell below that required or expected of them . '' On 30 April 2005 , Azelle Rodney , from London , was shot dead by armed officers of the Metropolitan Police . In August 2007 , coroner Andrew Walker , sitting at Hornsey North London , said that a full inquest into Rodney 's death could not be held because of the large number of redactions in police officers ' statements . In July 2013 a judicial inquiry found that the Authorised Firearms Officer who fired the fatal shots had `` no lawful justification '' for opening fire . The case was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) to determine whether a prosecution should be launched . On 22 July 2005 , Jean Charles de Menezes , a Brazilian national living in London , was shot dead by unnamed Metropolitan Police officers on board an Underground train at Stockwell tube station , in the belief he was a suicide bomber . He was shot in the back of the head 7 times . Initially , police claimed incorrectly that he was wearing bulky clothing and that he had vaulted the ticket barriers running from police when challenged , but did not modify their statement until the correct information was leaked to the press . They later issued an apology , saying that they had mistaken him for a suspect in the previous day 's failed bombings and acknowledging that de Menezes in fact had no explosives and was unconnected with the attempted bombings . Following an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) , the Crown Prosecution Service announced on 17 July 2006 , that no charges would be brought against any individual officers in relation to the death of Jean Charles . Sir Ian Blair , Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police when the shooting occurred will , however , face charges under Health and Safety legislation from his professional -- rather than personal -- capacity . The family of Jean Charles has called on the government to open a public inquiry into the shooting . In June 2007 Anne Sanderson was shot dead by an armed officer in Sevenoaks , Kent after being seen with what was later identified as a BB gun , which she refused to relinquish when challenged by police . It was the first fatal shooting of a woman by UK Police in 27 years ( and first time ever that the shooting was deliberate ) . A month previously police officers had found notes in Sanderson 's car which had suicidal connotations , but no action was taken . A subsequent IPCC investigation noted this , as well as other procedural issues in the investigation , but stated that they `` did not have a negative impact on the incident 's outcome '' . In addition , the report said that officers involved `` performed their duties conscientiously and diligently '' and that an inquest jury returned a verdict of lawful killing . On 6 May 2008 Mark Saunders , a barrister , was shot by police following a siege at his home in Markham Square , Chelsea , London . On 29 October 2008 Andrew Hammond , 40 , was shot after threatening people with a firearm in Romford . In May 2009 Keith Richards , 47 , was shot while brandishing a crossbow at police in Shildon , County Durham . On 8 May 2009 Mervyn Tussler , 64 , was shot after he opened fire at police at a retirement home in Worthing , Sussex . Tussler had earlier threatened a member of the home staff with a handgun , and threatened to kill himself . On 28 December 2010 Alistair Bell , 42 , shot and injured an unarmed police officer responding to threats by Bell to kill a woman and her husband . Bell subsequently fired a further 43 shots at officers before being shot himself . On 10 February 2011 , Michael Fitzpatrick , 49 , wanted in connection with a series of armed robberies , was shot by police in Kemptown , Sussex . On 4 August 2011 , Mark Duggan was shot dead by the MPS , sparking massive riots across London and other cities in England . Four officers are being investigated in the incident , although it was speculated `` in leaks from official sources to The Times newspaper ... that the firearms officer ( would ) be cleared of any wrongdoing on the basis that he had `` an honest - held belief that he was in imminent danger of him or his colleagues being shot '' . On 3 March 2012 , Anthony Grainger was shot dead in Cheshire by an armed Greater Manchester Police officer whilst sitting in a stolen car . Grainger was unarmed at the time of the shooting . Chief Constable Peter Fahy was charged under health and safety legislation over the shooting . On 5 September 2014 Dean Joseph , 40 , was shot after holding a woman at knifepoint in Islington , London . On 30 August 2015 James Fox , 43 , was shot after making threats to kill with a firearm in Enfield , London . On 22 October 2015 Richard Davies was shot by police in St Neots , Cambridgeshire . On 1 May 2016 , William Smith , 36 , was shot dead during a police raid in Kent in connection with the killing of Roy Blackman , 73 , during a burglary ten days previously . Firearms recovered at the scene .",

Section 3 of the 20th Amendment provides that if the president - elect dies before his term begins , the vice president - elect becomes president on Inauguration Day and serves for the full term to which the president - elect was elected . The section also provides that if , on Inauguration Day , a president has not been chosen or the president - elect does not qualify for the presidency , the vice president - elect acts as president until a president is chosen or the president - elect qualifies . Finally , Section 3 allows the Congress to provide by law for cases in which neither a president - elect nor a vice president - elect is eligible or available to serve . The 25th Amendment , ratified in 1967 , clarified Article II , Section 1 : that the vice president is the direct successor of the president . He or she becomes president if the president dies , resigns or is removed from office . The amendment also provides for the situation where the president is temporarily disabled , such as if the president has a surgical procedure or becomes mentally unfit . The amendment also provides for vice presidential succession , by requiring vice presidential vacancies to be filled by the president and confirmed by both houses of the Congress .

In the poem , Goldsmith criticises rural depopulation , the moral corruption found in towns , consumerism , enclosure , landscape gardening , avarice , and the pursuit of wealth from international trade . The poem employs , in the words of one critic , `` deliberately precise obscurity '' , and does not reveal the reason why the village has been deserted .

Commentators at the event predicted that while the film would become a contender for several accolades , it would likely not become a forerunner in the pursuit for Academy Award nominations . A promotional campaign commenced thereafter , including a Lisbeth Salander - inspired collection , designed by Trish Summerville for H&M . The worldwide premiere was at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on December 12 , 2011 , followed by the American opening at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on December 14 and Stockholm the next day . Sony 's target demographics were men and women over the age of 25 and 17 -- 34 . The film went into general release in North America on December 21 , at 2,700 theaters , expanding to 2,974 theaters on its second day . The United Kingdom release was on December 26 , Russia on January 1 , 2012 , and Japan on February 13 . India and Vietnam releases were abandoned due to censorship concerns . A press statement from the Central Board of Film Certification stated : `` Sony Pictures will not be releasing The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in India . The censor board has judged the film unsuitable for public viewing in its unaltered form and , while we are committed to maintaining and protecting the vision of the director , we will , as always , respect the guidelines set by the board . '' In contrast , the National Film Board of Vietnam insisted that the film 's withdrawal had no relation to rigid censorship guidelines , as it had not been reviewed by the committee .",

( The scarce and fugitive fifth halogen , the radioactive astatine , is not well - studied due to its expense and inaccessibility in large quantities , but appears to show various unusual properties due to relativistic effects . ) Iodine has an electron configuration of ( Kr ) 4d 5s 5p , with the seven electrons in the fifth and outermost shell being its valence electrons . Like the other halogens , it is one electron short of a full octet and is hence a strong oxidising agent , reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell , although in keeping with periodic trends , it is the weakest oxidising agent among the stable halogens : it has the lowest electronegativity among them , just 2.66 on the Pauling scale ( compare fluorine , chlorine , and bromine at 3.98 , 3.16 , and 2.96 respectively ; astatine continues the trend with an electronegativity of 2.2 ) . Elemental iodine hence forms diatomic molecules with chemical formula I , where two iodine atoms share a pair of electrons in order to each achieve a stable octet for themselves ; at high temperatures , these diatomic molecules reversibly dissociate a pair of iodine atoms . Similarly , the iodide anion , I , is the strongest reducing agent among the stable halogens , being the most easily oxidised back to diatomic I.

Whitney 's gin used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through , while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint to prevent jams . It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States , but also led to the growth of slavery in the American South as the demand for cotton workers rapidly increased .

Work on the White Tower -- which gives the whole castle its name -- is usually considered to have begun in 1078 , however the exact date is uncertain . William made Gundulf , Bishop of Rochester , responsible for its construction , although it may not have been completed until after William 's death in 1087 . The White Tower is the earliest stone keep in England , and was the strongest point of the early castle . It also contained grand accommodation for the king . At the latest , it was probably finished by 1100 when Bishop Ranulf Flambard was imprisoned there . Flambard was loathed by the English for exacting harsh taxes . Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower , he was also the first person to escape from it , using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine . He was held in luxury and permitted servants , but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors . After plying them with drink , when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber , and out of the Tower . The escape came as such a surprise that one contemporary chronicler accused the bishop of witchcraft .",

In addition to coastline lengths , this is the source of the land area used to calculate the `` coast / area ratio '' for both TWF and WRI coastline measurement . This ratio measures how many meters of coastline correspond to every square kilometer of land area . The ratio illustrates the ease of accessibility to the country 's coast from every point in its interior . Therefore , an island country like Maldives , or a country carved by the sea like Greece , is more likely to have a high ratio , while a landlocked country will have a ratio of zero . Note that the scales at which The World Factbook figures were measured are not stated , nor is it known whether the figures are all reported using the same scale , thus the figures are not necessarily comparable across different countries . Data marked World Resources Institute or WRI covers 182 independent countries and 13 dependencies , based on data calculated in 2000 from the World Vector Shoreline , United States Defense Mapping Agency , 1989 . It may include territories whose status have changed . According to their technical notes , the `` coastline length was derived from the World Vector Shoreline database at 1 : 250,000 scale . The estimates ( ... ) were calculated using a Geographic Information System ( GIS ) and an underlying database consistent for the entire world . The methodology used to estimate length is based on the following : 1 ) A country 's coastline is made up of individual lines , and an individual line has two or more vertices and / or nodes . 2 ) The length between two vertices is calculated on the surface of a sphere . 3 ) The sum of the lengths of the pairs of vertices is aggregated for each individual line , and 4 ) the sum of the lengths of individual lines was aggregated for a country . In general , the coastline length of islands that are part of a country , but are not overseas territories , are included in the coastline estimate for that country ( e.g. , Canary Islands are included in Spain ) .

Even so , Hipparcos is only able to measure parallax angles for stars up to about 1,600 light - years away , a little more than one percent of the diameter of the Milky Way Galaxy . The European Space Agency 's Gaia mission , launched in December 2013 , will be able to measure parallax angles to an accuracy of 10 microarcseconds , thus mapping nearby stars ( and potentially planets ) up to a distance of tens of thousands of light - years from Earth . In April 2014 , NASA astronomers reported that the Hubble Space Telescope , by using spatial scanning , can now precisely measure distances up to 10,000 light - years away , a ten-fold improvement over earlier measurements .",

            "sentence": "The westernmost extension of Asia is an irregular region roughly included within the circuit of waters marked out by the Caspian and Black seas on the north , by the Mediterranean and Red seas on the west , and by the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf on the south and east . It is a region consisting chiefly of mountains in the north and desert in the south . The earliest home of men in this great arena of Western Asia is a borderland between the desert and the mountains , a kind of cultivable fringe of the desert , a fertile crescent having the mountains on one side and the desert on the other . This fertile crescent is approximately a semicircle , with the open side toward the south , having the west end at the southeast corner of the Mediterranean , the center directly north of Arabia , and the east end at the north end of the Persian Gulf ( see map , p. 100 ) . It lies like an army facing south , with one wing stretching along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean and the other reaching out to the Persian Gulf , while the center has its back against the northern mountains . The end of the western wing is Palestine ; Assyria makes up a large part of the center ; while the end of the eastern wing is Babylonia . This great semicircle , for lack of a name , may be called the Fertile Crescent . It may also be likened to the shores of a desert - bay , upon which the mountains behind look down -- a bay not of water but of sandy waste , some eight hundred kilometres across , forming a northern extension of the Arabian desert and sweeping as far north as the latitude of the northeast corner of the Mediterranean . This desert - bay is a limestone plateau of some height -- too high indeed to be watered by the Tigris and Euphrates , which have cut ca\u00f1ons obliquely across it . Nevertheless , after the meager winter rains , wide tracts of the northern desert - bay are clothed with scanty grass , and spring thus turns the region for a short time into grasslands . The history of Western Asia may be described as an age - long struggle between the mountain peoples of the north and the desert wanderers of these grasslands -- a struggle which is still going on -- for the possession of the Fertile Crescent , the shores of the desert - bay . There is no name , either geographical or political , which includes all of this great semicircle ( see map , p. 100 ) . Hence we are obliged to coin a term and call it the Fertile Crescent .",

Hibernian were the first British club to play in the European Cup , reaching the semi-finals of the inaugural tournament in 1955 . The English league winners , Chelsea , were denied entry by the Football League 's secretary Alan Hardaker , who believed it was in the best interests of English football and football in general for them not to enter .

            "sentence": "Those leucite rocks which contain abundant essential plagioclase feldspar are known as leucite tephrites and leucite basanites . The former consist mainly of plagioclase , leucite and augite , while the latter contain olivine in addition . The leucite is often present in two sets of crystals , both porphyritic and as an ingredient of the ground mass . It is always idiomorphic with rounded outlines . The feldspar ranges from bytownite to oligoclase , being usually a variety of labradorite ; orthoclase is scarce . The augite varies a good deal in chemnistry and optical character , being green , brown or violet ( suggesting high Na and Ti content ) , but it is rarely high enough in Na and Fe to qualify as aegirine - augite or aegirine . Among the accessory minerals biotite , brown hornblende , hauyne , iron oxides and apatite are the commonest ; melanite and nepheline may also occur . The ground mass of these rocks is only occasionally rich in glass . The leucite - tephrites and leucite - basanites of Vesuvius and Somma are familiar examples of this class of rocks . They are black or ashy - grey in color , often vesicular , and may contain many large grey phenocysts of leucite . Their black augite and yellow green olivine are also easily observed in hand specimens . From Volcan Ello , Sardinia and Roccamonfina similar rocks are obtained ; they occur also in Bohemia , in Java , Celebes , Kilimanjaro ( Africa ) and near Trebizond in Asia Minor .",

The notion of a power too great for humans to safely possess is an evocative one , and already in the 1930s there were technologies available to suggest the idea . By the time the work was published , though not when most of it was written , the existence of nuclear power and nuclear weapons were common knowledge , and the Ring was often taken as symbolic of them . The effect of the Ring and its physical and spiritual after - effects on Bilbo and Frodo are obsessions that have been compared with drug addiction ; actor Andy Serkis who played Gollum in the film trilogy cited drug addiction as an inspiration for his performance .",

            "sentence": "Admission of the existence of a contract by the defendant under oath . A statute of frauds defense may also be affected by a showing of part performance by proving the existence of one of two different conditions . If the parties have taken action in reliance on the agreement , as in the case Riley v. Capital Airlines , Inc. , the court held that part performance does not take an executory portion of a contract out of the statute of frauds . Each performance constitutes a contract that falls outside the Statute of Frauds and was enforceable to the extent it is executed . However , the unexecuted portion of the contract falls within the Statute of Frauds and is unenforceable . As a result , only the executed portion of the contract can be recovered , and the doctrine of part performance does not remove the contract from the statute . On the other hand , the court , in Schwedes v. Romain , held that partial performance and grounds for estoppel can make the contract effective . Promissory estoppel can be applied in many but not all jurisdictions when the charging party detrimentally relies on the otherwise unenforceable contract . In England and Wales , the circumstances where promissory estoppel may be used to overcome the statute are limited , and some jurisdictions deny this possibility altogether . The `` main purpose rule '' as it relates to guarantee or suretyship type contracts : where the promisor 's promise to answer for the debt of another is made mainly for the promisor 's own economic advantage , then it is a primary promise , and enforceable even without a writing . Easements by implication : easements , which are agreements that permit the use of real estate by someone who has no property interest in the land , may be created by operation of law rather than by written instrument . This may happen where , for example , a piece of land is partitioned between owners and pre-existing utilities routes or access paths that would otherwise be trespassory over one of the plots is reasonably necessary for enjoyment of the other plot . In such case , the pre-existing use must be apparent and continuous at the time of the partition for an easement to be created by implication . The implied easement constitutes an interest in land that does not require a writing to be enforceable .",

So when a score like The Lion King is competing against a drama like Forrest Gump , it 's apples and oranges -- not in the quality of the score , but in the way it functions in the movie . There 's a big difference . '' The category was therefore split into Best Original Dramatic Score and Best Original Musical or Comedy Score in 1996 . This change proved unpopular in the other branches of the Academy as Charles Bernstein , chairman of the Academy 's rules committee , noted that `` no other Oscar category depended on a film 's genre '' and `` the job of composing an underscore for a romantic comedy is not substantially different from working on a heavy drama . '' This split was reverted in 2000 .",

They play pivotal roles in diverse cellular activities including growth ( by signaling neurotrophins ) , differentiation , metabolism , adhesion , motility , death . RTKs are composed of an extracellular domain , which is able to bind a specific ligand , a transmembrane domain , and an intracellular catalytic domain , which is able to bind and phosphorylate selected substrates . Binding of a ligand to the extracellular region causes a series of structural rearrangements in the RTK that lead to its enzymatic activation . In particular , movement of some parts of the kinase domain gives free access to adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and the substrate to the active site . This triggers a cascade of events through phosphorylation of intracellular proteins that ultimately transmit ( `` transduce '' ) the extracellular signal to the nucleus , causing changes in gene expression . Many RTKs are involved in oncogenesis , either by gene mutation , or chromosome translocation , or simply by over-expression . In every case , the result is a hyper - active kinase , that confers an aberrant , ligand - independent , non-regulated growth stimulus to the cancer cells .",

'' Orwell says that Arms and the Man wears well -- he was writing 50 years later -- because its moral -- that war is not a wonderful , romantic adventure -- still needs to be told . His other plays of the period , equally well written , are about issues no longer controversial . For example , the theme of Mrs. Warren 's Profession , which so shocked audiences at the time , was that the causes of prostitution are mainly economic , hardly big news today , and the play Widowers ' Houses was an attack on slum landlords , who are now held in such low esteem that the matter is hardly controversial .",

Although she has said she loves Dwight and cares about him , she refuses to tell anyone about their relationship , and is often made uncomfortable by Dwight 's passion for her . Their relationship is seemingly summarized in `` A.A.R.M. '' : when Dwight tells her that yelling through a megaphone expresses `` how loudly I love you '' , Angela meekly whispers `` It 's too loud . '' In `` Traveling Salesman '' Angela forgets to send an accounting folder to corporate , so Dwight drives to New York and gives the folder to them . After Dwight is told he would be fired if he did n't tell Michael why he went to New York , he keeps their relationship secret out of respect for Angela . Angela later tells Michael what happened , but still does n't reveal their relationship . In `` Fun Run '' Angela asks Dwight to feed her cat Sprinkles , who is feeling sick , but Dwight kills it , which causes Angela to break up with him . After Angela begins a relationship with Andy in Season 4 , she stops dating Dwight , but at the end of `` Goodbye Toby '' Phyllis sees Angela cheating on Andy with Dwight . Dwight ends their affair in `` The Duel '' after learning that she has been having sexual relations with Andy . In `` The Delivery '' Dwight , who wants to improve his sales by having a child , asks Angela to have his baby . The two write up a contract and plan to have a baby together , but in `` Happy Hour '' , Dwight hooks up with Pam 's friend Isabel , and tells Angela he does n't want her to have his baby . In `` The Chump '' the two call in a lawyer , and Angela refuses to release him from the contract unless he agrees to have sex with her five times . She later voids the contract after meeting Senator Robert Lipton . After she gives birth ( Jury Duty ) , Dwight realizes the baby was conceived before her marriage to Robert and makes the assumption that he , not Robert , is the father . Angela and Dwight go through a paternity test and in `` New Guys '' it is revealed that Dwight is not Philip 's father . In `` A.A.R.M. '' Dwight proposes to Angela , and she accepts . She then tells Dwight that she lied before and Dwight is Philip 's father . Angela tells him that she wanted to make sure that Dwight wanted to marry her for no other reason than for love .",

Donald Mustard , creative lead at Epic , said in 2017 that this announcement was `` three weeks after we came up with the idea , before we even made the game '' . The title , which started out as an internal game jam project , represents a departure from the company 's previous work . As Bleszinski explained during the Spike event , Epic wanted to `` switch things up a little bit and do something different and fun '' with Fortnite , describing it as `` a world where you explore , you scavenge , you build and ultimately you survive . '' In an interview with Engadget , he also echoed these statements , claiming that the game would be different from the Gears of War series : `` There 's no dudebros in it ... Not that there 's anything wrong with that , right ? But creatively for the team , Gears has been amazing for us . But it 's fun to kind of stretch our wings and do something that 's a little different from the usual . '' Epic Games Vice President of Publishing Mike Fischer said in 2015 that Epic recognized that they `` announced this game too soon '' , and that its lengthy development period was due to `` very good reasons .

Venus and Serena Williams had claimed that they could beat any male player ranked outside the world 's top 200 , so Braasch , then ranked 203rd , challenged them both . Braasch was described by one journalist as `` a man whose training regime centered around a pack of cigarettes and more than a couple bottles of ice cold lager '' . The matches took place on court number 12 in Melbourne Park , after Braasch had finished a round of golf and two shandies . He first took on Serena and after leading 5 -- 0 , beat her 6 -- 1 . Venus then walked on court and again Braasch was victorious , this time winning 6 -- 2 . Braasch said afterwards , `` 500 and above , no chance '' . He added that he had played like someone ranked 600th in order to keep the game `` fun '' . Braasch said the big difference was that men can chase down shots much easier , and that men put spin on the ball that the women ca n't handle . The Williams sisters adjusted their claim to beating men outside the top 350 .",

Thompson also notes the similar ceramic designs in the Chichen Itza area which are known to have ceased in the early thirteenth century . British historian Clive Ruggles suggests , based on the analyses of several scholars , that the Dresden Codex is a copy and was originally written between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries .

In the Old Testament , the word is used to translate several Hebrew words , including Hod ( \u05d4\u05d5\u05d3 ) and kabod , and in the New Testament it is used to translate the Greek word doxa ( \u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03b1 ) . The Hebrew word kabod ( K-B-D ) originally means `` weight '' or `` heaviness . '' The same word is then used to express importance , honor , and majesty . Greek versions of the Hebrew Bible translated this concept with the word \u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03b1 , which was then used extensively in the New Testament as well . Doxa originally means `` judgment , opinion '' , and by extension , `` good reputation , honor '' . Assuming that these various words and uses should refer to a single underlying concept , St. Augustine renders it as clara notitia cum laude , `` brilliant celebrity with praise '' .",

'' She is good friends with Elizabeth and Abigail . In `` These Games , '' she also helps Jack catch a thief . Florence Blakeley is a feisty gossip in Hope Valley . She often has a pessimistic perspective and always seems to find the negative , even in a very positive situation .

            "sentence": "However , once a stimulus activates the voltage - gated sodium channels to open , positive sodium ions flood into the cell and the voltage increases . This process can also be initiated by ligand or neurotransmitter binding to a ligand - gated channel . More sodium is outside the cell relative to the inside , and the positive charge within the cell propels the outflow of potassium ions through delayed - rectifier voltage - gated potassium channels . Since the potassium channels within the cell membrane are delayed , any further entrance of sodium activates more and more voltage - gated sodium channels . Depolarization above threshold results in an increase in the conductance of Na sufficient for inward sodium movement to swamp outward potassium movement immediately . If the influx of sodium ions fails to reach threshold , then sodium conductance does not increase a sufficient amount to override the resting potassium conductance . If successful , the sudden influx of positive charge depolarizes the membrane , and potassium is delayed in re-establishing , or hyperpolarizing , the cell . Sodium influx depolarizes the cell in attempt to establish its own equilibrium potential ( about + 52 mV ) to make the inside of the cell more positive relative to the outside .",

For example , the methyl radical ( CH ) has an unpaired electron in a non-bonding orbital on the carbon atom , and no electron of opposite spin in the same orbital . Another example is the chlorine radical produced by CFCs , known to be harmful to the ozone layer . Six - electron species are highly reactive and short lived . An example is the carbenes , which have two unshared valence electrons on the same carbon atom in a triplet or singlet state . Another example is BH , which dimerizes into diborane ( B H ) to achieve stability . Other rules : The duet rule of the first shell -- the noble gas helium has two electrons in its outer shell , which is very stable . ( Since there is no 1p subshell , 1s is followed immediately by 2s , and thus shell 1 can only have at most 2 valence electrons ) . Hydrogen only needs one additional electron to attain this stable configuration , while lithium needs to lose one . For transition metals , some classes of molecule tend to obey the 18 - electron rule which corresponds to the utilization of valence - shell s , p and d orbitals to form bonding and non-bonding orbitals . However newer theoretical treatments support a model with the duodectet rule ( 12 electrons ) using mainly the d and s valence orbitals . The exclusion of p orbitals for transition metal atoms is analogous to the exclusion of d orbitals for hypervalent molecules of main group atoms . ( See hypervalent molecules below ) .",

While the key carrier technology of the first Industrial Revolution ( 1770 -- 1850 ) was based on water - powered mechanization , the second Kondratiev wave ( 1850 -- 1900 ) was enabled by steam - powered technology , the third ( 1900 -- 1940 ) was characterized by the electrification of social and productive organization , the fourth by motorization and the automated mobilization of society ( 1940 -- 1970 ) , and the most recent one by the digitization of social systems . Each one of those so - called long waves has been characterized by a sustained period of social modernization , most notably by sustained periods of increasing economic productivity .

Digital Information and Communication Technologies fulfill those requirements and therefore represent a general purpose technology that can transform an entire economy , leading to a modern , and more developed form of socio - economic and political organization often referred to as the post-industrial society , the fifth Kondratiev , Information society , digital age , and network society , among others .",

In the Earliest Ordovician , around 480 Ma , the microcontinent of Avalonia -- a landmass incorporating fragments of what would become eastern Newfoundland , the southern British Isles , and parts of Belgium , northern France , Nova Scotia , New England , South Iberia and northwest Africa -- broke free from Gondwana and began its journey to Laurentia . Baltica , Laurentia , and Avalonia all came together by the end of the Ordovician to form a minor supercontinent called Euramerica or Laurussia , closing the Iapetus Ocean . The collision also resulted in the formation of the northern Appalachians . Siberia sat near Euramerica , with the Khanty Ocean between the two continents .

Job losses were less severe among women , workers in nondurable industries ( such as food and clothing ) , services and sales workers , and those employed by the government . Unskilled inner city men had much higher unemployment rates . Age also played a factor : young people had a hard time getting their first job , and men over the age of 45 , if they lost their job , would rarely find another one because employers had their choice of younger men . Millions were hired in the Great Depression , but men with weaker credentials were never hired , and fell into a long - term unemployment trap . The migration that brought millions of farmers and townspeople to the bigger cities in the 1920s suddenly reversed itself , as unemployment made the cities unattractive , and the network of kinfolk and more ample food supplies made it wise for many to go back . City governments in 1930 - 31 tried to meet the depression by expanding public works projects , as president Herbert Hoover strongly encouraged . However , tax revenues were plunging , and the cities as well as private relief agencies were totally overwhelmed by 1931 ; no one was able to provide significant additional relief . People fell back on the cheapest possible relief , soup kitchens which provided free meals for anyone who showed up . After 1933 new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress of the cities , but the budgets did not fully recover until 1941 .",

            "sentence": "Despite these allusions , research by the legal historian Professor R. Probert of Warwick University has failed to find any proof of an actual contemporary practice of jumping over a broomstick as a sign of informal union . Probert also points out that the word broomstick was used in the mid-18th century in several contexts to mean ' something ersatz , or lacking the authority its true equivalent might possess . ' She therefore argues that because the expression broomstick marriage , meaning ' sham marriage ' , was in circulation , folk etymology led to a belief that people must actually have once signified irregular marriage by jumping over a broom.. Tyler D. Parry , Associate Professor of African American Studies , contests the claim that no literal jump was used in Britain , arguing that enslaved people of African descent and British migrants engaged in numerous cultural exchanges during the 18th and 19th centuries . He shows numerous correlations between the ceremonies of slaves and those of the rural British , contending it is not simply coincidental that two groups , separated by an ocean , utilized similar matrimonial forms revolving around the broomstick . If British practitioners never used a physical leap , Parry wonders how enslaved people in the US South learned of the custom .",

It does this by extracting information from the environment using sensory receptors , sending signals that encode this information into the central nervous system , processing the information to determine an appropriate response , and sending output signals to muscles or glands to activate the response . The evolution of a complex nervous system has made it possible for various animal species to have advanced perception abilities such as vision , complex social interactions , rapid coordination of organ systems , and integrated processing of concurrent signals .

With chord types , such as chords with added sixths or chords over pedal points , more than one possible chordal analysis may be possible . For example , in a tonal piece of music , the notes C , E , G , A , sounded as a chord , could be analyzed as a C major sixth chord in root position ( a major triad -- C , E , G -- with an added sixth -- A -- above the root ) or as a first inversion A minor seventh chord ( the A minor seventh chord contains the notes A , C , E and G , but in this example , the C note , the third of the A minor chord , is in the bass ) . Deciding which note is the root of this chord could be determined by considering context . If the chord spelled C , E , G , A occurs immediately before a D chord ( spelled D , F \u266f , A , C ) , most theorists and musicians would consider the first chord a minor seventh chord in first inversion , because the progression ii -- V is a standard chord movement .",

            "sentence": "Kristen Bell as Eleanor Shellstrop , a deceased saleswoman from Arizona who entered an afterlife utopia called `` The Good Place '' seemingly after being mistaken for a human rights lawyer by the same name . With the aid of her alleged soulmate , Chidi , she attempts to reform by learning about ethics , believing she still has a chance to earn a legitimate spot in The Good Place . Now that Eleanor knows about Michael 's experiments and the memory wipes , Eleanor became the de facto leader in the group `` Team Cockroach '' after she makes a truce with Michael to keep Shawn from finding out about the reboots in exchange for helping the humans get to the Real Good Place . William Jackson Harper as Chidi Anagonye , a deceased ethics professor who was born in Nigeria and raised in Senegal , supposed to be Eleanor 's soulmate . Reluctantly , he had hope to meet a soulmate he could bond with , but soon discovers that he and Eleanor were meant to be soulmates because he was always there for her . He is the first person to learn her secret and begins teaching her about ethics to reform both her and Jason . He died on earth when an air conditioner fell on his head outside his apartment building . Chidi speaks French , but in this afterlife , his speech is translated into whatever languages people who listen to him speak ; therefore , he appears to speak English to Eleanor and the audience . Jameela Jamil as Tahani Al - Jamil , a deceased , wealthy philanthropist who traveled extensively around the world . She was born in Pakistan , raised in England , and went to school in France . Tahani , whose full name means `` Congratulations Beautiful , '' is a seemingly - good - natured soul with a cheerful and helpful attitude who was constantly overshadowed by her younger sister , Kamilah during her time on Earth . She died on Earth when a statue of her sister fell on her at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland , Ohio . She gradually learns the truth about Eleanor and Jason following Eleanor 's arrival . Initially , Eleanor dislikes Tahani , finding her positive attitude , condescending manner , and her tendency to name drop obnoxious , but the two eventually become friends . D'Arcy Carden as Janet , a programmed guide who acts as the neighborhood 's main source of information , analogous to an intelligent personal assistant . She is the 25th generation of `` Janet '' programs like her , dating back to a predecessor featuring a click - wheel . She has infinite knowledge of the universe , can provide residents anything they desire , and details everything of what is happening in the Good Place but does have some flaws . Since she is the only individual who came from a true Good Place ( Michael admits to having stolen her in the season 1 finale ) , Janet is subject to numerous reboots ; she pleads with whomever tries to push a red button that shuts her down not to kill her , even going as far as showing pictures ( like an ultrasound of an unborn baby or showing off her `` children '' ) before she falls to the ground . These reboots give Janet increased abilities as well as programming capabilities that compel her to make humans happy , as she 'll only answer to what the humans want her to do , including keeping their secrets to escaping the Bad Place . Janet is incompatible with lies and must tell the objective truth . In season 1 , after she was rebooted the first time , Jason and Janet fell in love with each other and got married . Despite the fact Janet is not human , she and Jason attempted many times in vain to consummate their marriage , without success . It is revealed in season 2 that her feelings for Jason have intensified with each reboot . Also in season 2 , as Janet becomes more self aware with each reboot , she realizes that the experimental created neighborhood may explode or implode due to her computer glitches , and she begs Michael to `` kill '' her and turn her into a marble . Demon Michael , after having attended so many of Chidi 's lessons on ethics and philosophy , can not bring himself to permanently disable Janet , because Michael now considers Janet to be his best friend . Since Michael will not agree to permanently disable her and turn her into a marble , in order to pacify herself and avoid further earthquakes and the possible destruction of the neighborhood Janet creates a new boyfriend for herself . The boyfriend Janet creates is as anatomically incorrect as she is , with wind chimes for genitalia . Carden also plays `` Bad Janet '' , Janet 's counterpart from The Bad Place . Manny Jacinto as `` Jianyu Li '' , a supposedly silent Buddhist monk from Taiwan and Tahani 's soulmate . Eleanor discovers he is actually Jason Mendoza from Jacksonville , Florida , an amateur DJ , devoted Jacksonville Jaguars fan , and backup dancer who sold fake drugs to high school students . At first , Jason develops feelings for Janet because she is the only one who is nice to him but later forgot after they rebooted everybody 's memories , but later ended up sleeping with Tahani in season 2 . Ted Danson as Michael , the architect of The Good Place where Eleanor and her fellow humans reside . In the first - season finale , it is discovered that he is a Bad Place demon who constructed a fake `` Good Place '' to torture Eleanor , Chidi , Tahani , and Jason . Unfortunately , he ends up repeatedly restarting his experiment due to Eleanor ( and one time Jason ) always figuring out that `` The Good Place '' is `` The Bad Place , '' leading to his routine failure , as well as hiding the constant resets from Shawn in order to avoid `` retirement '' . As part of a truce he makes with Eleanor so his failing project will not be exposed and a chance to reform his behavior , Michael agrees to let the humans keep their memories and help them get into the true Good Place as well as to take Chidi 's ethics lessons .",

The size , geometry , and location of the receiving basin also plays an important role in delta evolution .

When factor analysis ( a statistical technique ) is applied to personality survey data , some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person . For example , someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as `` always prepared '' rather than `` messy '' . This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors . For example , extraversion is said to include such related qualities as gregariousness , assertiveness , excitement seeking , warmth , activity , and positive emotions .",

In the muscle , there are groups of highly specialized cells that work together to perform a function known as muscle contraction . A main component in the cytoskeleton that helps show the true function of this muscle contraction is known as a microfilament . Microfilaments are composed of the most abundant cellular protein known as actin . During contraction of a muscle , within each muscle cell , myosin molecular motors collectively exert forces on parallel actin filaments . Muscle contraction starts from nerve impulses which then causes increased amounts of calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum . Increases in calcium in the cytosol allows muscle contraction to begin with the help of two proteins , tropomyosin and troponin . Tropomyosin inhibits the interaction between actin and myosin , while troponin senses the increase in calcium and releases the inhibition . This action contracts the muscle cell , and through the synchronous process in many muscle cells , the entire muscle .",

See also : Szlachta history and political privileges , Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish - Lithuanian Commonwealth , Organisation and politics of the Polish - Lithuanian Commonwealth . The Case of Proclamations ( 1610 ) in England decided that `` the King by his proclamation or other ways can not change any part of the common law , or statute law , or the customs of the realm '' and that `` the King hath no prerogative , but that which the law of the land allows him . '' Dr. Bonham 's Case ( 1610 ) , decided that `` in many cases , the common law will control Acts of Parliament '' . The Virginia House of Burgesses , established in 1619 , is the first representative legislative body in the New World . The Mayflower Compact , signed in 1620 , an agreement between the Pilgrims , on forming a government between themselves , based on majority rule . During a period of renewed interest in Magna Carta , the Petition of Right ( 1628 ) was passed by the Parliament of England . It established , among other things , the illegality of taxation without parliamentary consent and of arbitrary imprisonment . The idea of the political party with factions took form in Britain around the time of the English Civil War ( 1642 -- 1651 ) . Soldiers from the Parliamentarian New Model Army and a faction of Levellers freely debated rights to political representation during the Putney Debates of 1647 . The Levellers published a newspaper ( The Moderate ) and pioneered political petitions , pamphleteering and party colours . Later , the pre-war Royalist ( then Cavalier ) and opposing Parliamentarian groupings became the Tory party and the Whigs in the Parliament .

A bill of rights is enacted by the Parliament of England in 1689 . The Bill of Rights 1689 set out the requirement for regular parliaments , free elections , rules for freedom of speech in Parliament , and limited the power of the monarch .

            "sentence": "During the final stage of the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs , Tenochtitlan was besieged and essentially razed . Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s understood the strategic and symbolic importance of the Aztec capital and founded the Spanish capital of Mexico City on the site , and in particular rebuilt the Aztec ceremonial and political center as the main square , the Plaza Mayor , usually called the Z\u00f3calo . Some of the oldest structures in Mexico City date from the early conquest era . Many colonial - era buildings remain standing and have been re-purposed government buildings and museums . As the seats of the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the Archbishopric of New Spain , Mexico City was the center of political and religious institutions , but it was also the center of Mexico 's economic activity and the residence of social elites in colonial Mexico ( 1521 -- 1821 ) . It was where the great merchant houses were located and the economic elites of the country lived , even if their sources of wealth were elsewhere . The concentration of mansions and palaces in what is now the Mexico City historic center led it to be nicknamed , the `` City of Palaces '' , a sobriquet often attributed to great savant Alexander von Humboldt , perhaps in error . It was also a major educational center , with the University of Mexico founded in 1553 as part of the complex of the Plaza Mayor . The crown - approved attempt to train Nahua men to become Christian priests saw the establishment in 1536 of the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco in one of the two sections of the capital governed by a Nahua city council ( cabildo ) . Many religious institutions for the education of the sons of Spanish elites were also based in the capital . Mexico City had the colony 's largest concentration of those of Spanish heritage ( both Iberian - born peninsulares and American - born criollos ) , as well as the largest concentration of mixed race casta population in the colony . Many Indians also lived outside the center of the capital .",

The empire which had once stretched from Spain to Jerusalem was now reduced to Anatolia , Chersonesos , and some fragments of Italy and the Balkans . The territorial losses were accompanied by a cultural shift ; urban civilization was massively disrupted , classical literary genres were abandoned in favor of theological treatises , and a new `` radically abstract '' style emerged in the visual arts . That the empire survived this period at all is somewhat surprising , especially given the total collapse of the Sassanid Empire in the face of the Arab expansion , but a remarkably coherent military reorganization helped to withstand the exterior pressures and laid the groundwork for the gains of the following dynasty . However , the massive cultural and institutional restructuring of the Empire consequent on the loss of territory in the seventh century has been said to have caused a decisive break in east Mediterranean Romanness and that the Byzantine state is subsequently best understood as another successor state rather than a real continuation of the Roman Empire .",

The story told in the book of Esther takes place during the rule of Ahasuerus , who has been identified as the 5th - century Persian king Xerxes I ( reigned 486 -- 465 BC ) . The author also displays an accurate knowledge of Persian customs and palaces . However , according to Coogan , considerable historical inaccuracies remain throughout the text , supporting the view that the book of Esther is to be read as a historical novella which tells a story describing historical events but is not necessarily historical fact . Edwin M. Yamauchi has questioned the reliability of other historical sources , such as Herodotus , to which Esther has been compared . Yamauchi wrote , `` ( Herodotus ) was , however , the victim of unreliable informants and was not infallible . '' The reason for questioning the historical accuracy of such ancient writers as Herodotus is that he is one of the primary sources of knowledge for this time period , and it has been frequently assumed that his account may be more accurate than Esther 's account . However , Jewish scholars and historians such as Mitchell First point out that although Herodotus traveled widely in the 460s and 450s B.C.E. , he probably never set foot in Persia , and his information about Persia is exclusively based , therefore , on what was told to him orally . As a consequence , if the presumed - reliable sources with which Coogan contrasts the book of Esther are not , in fact , reliable , then Coogan 's claims regarding Esther can not be said to hold historical weight .",

At the same time , Youngstown never became economically diversified , as did larger industrial cities such as Chicago , Pittsburgh , Akron , or Cleveland . Though population levels remained flat for a few more decades , population had not grown since the Great Depression , though General Motors had opened Lordstown Assembly in 1966 to help offset some losses . Hence , when economic changes forced the closure of plants throughout the 1970s , the city was left with few substantial economic alternatives . The 1969 corporate merger between the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company and the New Orleans - based Lykes Corporation proved to be a turning point in the demise of the local steel industry . The merger and subsequent takeover of Youngstown Sheet and Tube burdened the community 's primary steel producer with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt . Further , the deal placed control of the company outside of the Mahoning Valley . On September 19 , 1977 , it was announced a large portion of Youngstown Sheet and Tube would be closing . Although federal laws now require employers to give 60 days notice to its employees if they plan on doing mass layoffs , the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act was still eleven years from going into effect at the time , and Youngstown Sheet and Tube instantly put 5,000 workers out of work . The day is still known locally as `` Black Monday '' .",

            "sentence": "Since their first championship in 1923 , the New York Yankees have won two or more World Series titles in every decade except the 1980s , when they won none . Additionally , they have won at least one American League pennant in every decade since the 1920s . ( They have yet to win a pennant or Series in the 2010s . ) The Yankees are the only team in either League to win more than three series in a row , winning in four consecutive seasons from 1936 to 1939 , and a still MLB record five consecutive seasons from 1949 to 1953 . The New York Giants ' four World Series appearances from 1921 to 1924 are the most consecutive appearances for any National League franchise . The Yankees are the only American League franchise to appear in four or more consecutive World Series . The 1907 -- 1908 Cubs , 1921 -- 1922 Giants and the 1975 -- 1976 Reds are the only National League teams to win back - to - back World Series . The 1907 -- 1909 Detroit Tigers and the 1911 -- 1913 New York Giants are the only teams to lose three consecutive World Series . The Chicago Cubs hold the record for the longest World Series championship drought of all time , with no titles between 1908 and 2016 ( 108 years ) . They also hold the longest ever pennant drought of all time , which stretched from 1945 to 2016 . Their pennant drought ended with a 4 -- 2 series victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2016 NLCS . With the Cubs ' subsequent victory in the 2016 World Series , the longest World Series championship drought belongs to the Cleveland Indians , who have not won a World Series since 1948 . The Indians ' drought is the second longest championship drought among all four major professional sports leagues in North America ( MLB , NBA , NFL , and NHL ) ; only the NFL 's Arizona Cardinals , who last won a league championship in 1947 , when the team still operated as the Chicago Cardinals , have a longer championship drought . The team with the longest active pennant drought among AL teams that have played in a World Series at least once is the Baltimore Orioles , who have not reached a World Series since winning their last title in 1983 . The team with the longest active pennant drought among NL teams that have played in a World Series at least once is the Pittsburgh Pirates , who have not reached a World Series since winning their last title in 1979 . This also means that the Pirates hold the second longest active World Series title drought among all teams that have at least one Series and longest championship drought among NL teams that have won a Series . Twenty - three of the 28 teams to play in the World Series have won it at least once . The only exceptions are : Milwaukee Brewers ( formerly Seattle Pilots , 1969 ) , San Diego Padres ( 1969 ) , Colorado Rockies ( 1993 ) , Tampa Bay Rays ( formerly Devil Rays , 1998 ) , and Texas Rangers ( formerly Washington Senators , 1961 ) . The Padres and Rangers have both lost two World Series ; the remaining teams have all lost their only Series appearance . As of the present , all teams with three or more World Series appearances have won the World Series at least once . Two teams have never played in the World Series : the National League 's Washington Nationals ( formerly Montreal Expos , established in 1969 ) , and the American League 's Seattle Mariners ( established in 1977 ) . Both franchises have participated in post-season play and competed in a League Championship Series at least once , but neither team has any League Championship Series victories . The Red Sox have the most World Series titles before their first World Series loss , winning the championship in their first five appearances -- 1903 , 1912 , 1915 , 1916 , and 1918 -- before losing in the next series they played , in 1946 . The only other teams who have more than one Series victory before their first Series loss are the Chicago White Sox ( in 1906 and 1917 ) , the Cleveland Indians ( in 1920 and 1948 ) , the Toronto Blue Jays ( in 1992 and 1993 ) , and the Miami Marlins ( in 1997 and 2003 as the Florida Marlins ) . The Blue Jays and the Marlins have never lost a World Series . The American League 's Toronto Blue Jays ( 1992 and 1993 ) and National League 's Miami Marlins ( 1997 and 2003 as the Florida Marlins ) hold the record for most appearances in a Series without ever losing a Series . Two other franchises have won their lone appearance : the National League 's Arizona Diamondbacks ( 2001 ) and American League 's Los Angeles Angels ( 2002 as the Anaheim Angels ) . The Pirates , Reds , Red Sox , and Giants are tied with the longest active streak of World Series victories ( three ) since the last time they lost a series . After losing the 1927 series to the Yankees , the Pirates have emerged victorious in the next three series in which they played ( 1960 , 1971 , and 1979 ) . The Reds last series loss prior to their current active streak of three titles ( 1975 , 1976 , and 1990 ) was in 1972 . The Red Sox are the American League leaders in this category with three consecutive titles ( 2004 , 2007 , and 2013 ) since their last series loss ( 1986 ) . The Giants lost in 2002 before winning the next three they appeared in ( 2010 , 2012 , and 2014 ) . The Yankees have the most World Series victories ( eight ) between World Series losses . After losing the 1926 World Series to the Cardinals , the Yankees won their next eight appearances in the series ( 1927 , 1928 , 1932 , 1936 , 1937 , 1938 , 1939 , and 1941 ) before losing in 1942 to the Cardinals again . After this loss , the Yankees went on to win their next seven Series appearances ( 1943 , 1947 , 1949 , 1950 , 1951 , 1952 , and 1953 ) before their next Series loss in 1955 to the Brooklyn Dodgers . The Cardinals are the National League leader in this category , with four titles ( 1944 , 1946 , 1964 , and 1967 ) between series losses in 1943 and 1968 . The Cubs and Dodgers are tied at seven apiece for most World Series losses between World Series victories . The Dodgers lost their first seven appearances in the Fall Classics ( 1916 , 1920 , 1941 , 1947 , 1949 , 1952 , and 1953 ) before winning their first title in 1955 . The Cubs ' situation was the opposite : between winning their last two titles ( in 1908 and 2016 ) , they lost the World Series in 1910 , 1918 , 1929 , 1932 , 1935 , 1938 , and 1945 . The Cleveland Indians have four World Series losses ( 1954 , 1995 , 1997 , and 2016 ) since their last crown in 1948 , more than any other team in the American League . The longest duration without repeat World Series champions is sixteen years , dating back to the 2000 New York Yankees . The previous record of fourteen years ( in between the 1978 New York Yankees ' win and the 1993 Toronto Blue Jays ' win ) was broken when the San Francisco Giants , who won the 2014 World Series , did not qualify for the postseason in 2015 . The longest sequence of World Series in which each Series was won by a different franchise is 10 , from 1978 ( Yankees ) through 1987 ( Minnesota Twins ) . This streak was broken when the Dodgers , which had won in 1981 , won in 1988 .",

President Friedrich Ebert knew that Germany was in an impossible situation . Although he shared his countrymen 's disgust with the treaty , he was sober enough to consider the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject it . He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty , the Allies would invade Germany from the west -- and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion . With this in mind , he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event the Allies resumed the war . If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out , Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty . Hindenburg -- after prodding from his chief of staff , Wilhelm Groener -- concluded the army could not resume the war even on a limited scale . However , rather than inform Ebert himself , he had Groener inform the government that the army would be in an untenable position in the event of renewed hostilities . Upon receiving this , the new government recommended signing the treaty . The National Assembly voted in favour of signing the treaty by 237 to 138 , with five abstentions ( there were 421 delegates in total ) . This result was wired to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline . Foreign minister Hermann M\u00fcller and colonial minister Johannes Bell travelled to Versailles to sign the treaty on behalf of Germany . The treaty was signed on 28 June 1919 and ratified by the National Assembly on 9 July by a vote of 209 to 116 .",

It dictates that either batsman can be given out if he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action . It is governed by Law 37 of the laws of cricket , and is a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed : in the history of cricket , there have been only one instance in Test matches , six occasions in One Day International ( ODI ) games , and only one instance in Twenty20 International matches . However , there have also been seven instances in Test cricket , and two in ODIs , where a batsman has been dismissed handled the ball , a mode of dismissal now folded into obstructing the field . In most cases an obstruction occurs when a batsman thinks that he is going to be run out and he blocks the ball with his bat or changes his course while running between wickets to block the ball .

Kelly 's grandmother is seemingly confused ; she rarely speaks or does anything active , but no one seems to know why . `` Just Add Brains '' Joe Menendez Andrew Orenstein January 14 , 2016 ( 2016 - 01 - 14 ) The girls make Brain Boosting Bolognese to help with school and to understand the cookbook . But being know - it - alls has an unfortunate downside . The girls learn that the cookbook is seemingly infinite : trying to read through it they never seem to get any nearer to the last page . Also , three pages are torn out and missing , and the cookbook sometimes flips to a page on its own when the girls express their wish to accomplish a specific purpose . The girls learn that Kelly 's grandmother , Mama P , and Ms. Silvers were once young friends just like Kelly , Hannah , and Darbie , and that a strange woman named The Traveler gave them the cookbook . `` Just Add Dogs '' Joe Nussbaum TBA January 14 , 2016 ( 2016 - 01 - 14 ) To find a lost dog , the three friends cook up Lost and Found - ue , but end up attracting everything that has been lost in the neighborhood . The three missing pages from the cookbook float into Kelly 's bedroom . One of the items they return is a silver charm bracelet to Ms. Silvers , who says that it has been missing for many years . Later , she opens one of the charms and plants a seed from within it . `` Just Add Mom '' TBA John - Paul Nickel January 14 , 2016 ( 2016 - 01 - 14 ) Wanting more information from Mama P , the girls make Bitter Truth Truffle . However , Kelly 's mom eats one first . Kelly goes out with her mom to keep her from causing problems with her truth - telling . Hannah and Darbie both eat a truffle and find that telling the truth to each other is n't so bad , although they agree that without Kelly , they probably would n't be friends . Jake comes over , and unable to lie , they tell him all about the book and magic . They make him promise not to tell anyone . They get Mama P to eat a truffle , but before they can ask her anything , she eats a second one , which ends the spell 's effect on her . Mama P cooks a spell and tries to leave town , but a mysterious wind prevents her from crossing the town border . 5 5 `` Just Add Jake '' Joe Menendez Lauren Thompson January 14 , 2016 ( 2016 - 01 - 14 ) Not believing in magic , Jake mentions the cookbook to Mama P , and she steals it . But when she tries to look through it , all the pages go blank . The girls try to convince Jake that magic is real by trying out three random magical recipes on him , so that he 'll help them get the cookbook back . 6 6 `` Just Add Birthdays '' Elodie Keene Sarah Carbiener & Erica Rosbe January 14 , 2016 ( 2016 - 01 - 14 ) Kelly and Hannah make a cake for Darbie when they forget her birthday . They also make cookies with carob chips Mama P gave them several episodes earlier . Those who eat the cookies start acting much younger than normal . 7 7 `` Just Add Mama P '' Elodie Keene Andrew Orenstein January 14 , 2016 ( 2016 - 01 - 14 ) Convinced Mama P knows more than she 's letting on , the girls whip up some Mind Peering Peppermints . They hear nothing suspicious in her thoughts , which leads them to trust her . They try to read Ms. Silvers 's mind , and she immediately turns to them and tells them not to try it . 8 8 `` Just Add Besties '' Joe Nussbaum Luisa Leschin January 14 , 2016 ( 2016 - 01 - 14 ) Mama P mentors Kelly 's magic cooking skills , while Darbie and Hannah try to get a reclusive author 's autograph by cooking a spell that makes her their BFF . Mama P makes Kelly organize all the ingredients in her secret room , and then curses her and challenges her to overcome it without resorting to the cookbook . After a false start in which she invents a new spell , she does overcome the curse . The BFF spell works too well , and Darbie and Hannah 's attempt to end the spell fails . When they describe what they did , Kelly intuitively knows how to end the spell , and does . Mama P tells Ms. Silvers that Kelly has `` the gift '' just like her grandmother did , and Ms. Silvers warns Mama P not to make her curse Kelly the way she cursed Mama P . 9 9 `` Just Add Do - Overs '' Keith Samples John - Paul Nickel January 14 , 2016 ( 2016 - 01 - 14 ) The girls learn that long ago The Traveler gave Mama P , Ms. Silvers , and grandma each a morbium root seed ; morbium makes any recipe a thousand times more powerful . Mama P says hers is long gone , but the girls realize that Ms. Silvers 's was in the charm bracelet they returned to her . Hannah takes a piano lesson from Ms. Silvers to try to recover the seed , but things go wrong : Kelly 's brother breaks a lamp while under Kelly 's care , Darbie 's school project goes wrong , and Ms. Silvers catches Hannah and kicks her out . So the three girls cook up a `` do - over '' spell that resets time so they can try again . On the third try Darbie 's school project is a great success , Kelly realizes that her brother is acting out because he wants to spend time with her , and Hannah finds that Ms. Silvers 's charm bracelet is empty , but also finds a scrapbook filled with newspaper clippings about bad things that have happened around town . Mama P tells the girls that it is a listing of the curses Ms. Silvers has enacted . 10 10 `` Just Add Memories '' Vanessa Parise Lauren Thompson January 14 , 2016 ( 2016 - 01 - 14 ) Grandma , Mama P , and Ms. Silvers all have photos of Chuck Hankins , a boy from when they were young . The girls find that he went missing a long time ago . Kelly cooks a Pho - get Me Not spell to examine her memories of the day her grandmother got sick , hoping to find some clue as to what caused it , but eating the Pho - get Me Not makes her lose time and memories . She sees that her grandmother wanted to talk to her that day , but that she was too busy to talk to her grandmother . She sees that when her grandmother was driving her to a basketball tryout , Ms. Silvers walked up holding a box of ingredients that the girls later found in the attic . Willie Thompson , a man the girls helped previously , tells Hannah that Chuck disappeared from a Ferris Wheel , and that Chuck was dating Ms. Silvers , but that he went out with Grandma . The girls trade notes , and learn that on her last good day , Kelly 's grandmother went to the Cedros Forest . 11 11 `` Just Add Camping '' Keith Samples Sarah Carbiener & Erica Rosbe January 14 , 2016 ( 2016 - 01 - 14 ) Suspecting a clue to Kelly 's grandmother 's malady hides deep in the forest , the girls set up a Father / Daughter camping trip . While there they face their fears , and then meet The Traveler , who tells them that magic can heal Kelly 's grandmother if they are willing to pay the price . Later , the book flips open to a recipe that can break any curse , but the negative consequences will make things much worse . 12 12 `` Just Add Pluots Part 1 '' Joe Nussbaum Luisa Leschin January 14 , 2016 ( 2016 - 01 - 14 ) The girls consult with Mama P about the recipe that will break the curse . At first she says it 's too dangerous , but then she suggests that making more and having many people eat the results will dilute the negative consequences over all of them . Hannah gets Kelly grounded by her parents , worried that the magical price will be too high . Kelly escapes grounding by cooking a spell to make Darbie look like her . Hannah and Kelly argue at Mama P 's , and Hannah realizes that all the things in the scrapbook would benefit Mama P , not Ms. Silvers . She meets Ms. Silvers and they discuss Mama P 's plans . Ms. Silvers reveals that she too is cursed : outside her house , no one can hear her play music . Darbie tries to stop Mama P , but Mama P locks Darbie in her secret ingredient room and eats the first bite of the magic recipe , so her curse will be broken , rather than Kelly 's grandmother 's . Kelly goes home and gets yelled at by her mother , but manages to give her grandmother what she thinks is the first bite . 13 13 `` Just Add Pluots Part 2 '' Joe Nussbaum Andrew Orenstein January 14 , 2016 ( 2016 - 01 - 14 ) In 1965 , Rebecca Quinn ( Kelly 's grandmother ) is on the Ferris Wheel with Chuck . He takes a bite of a candy apple , and disappears . The three girls argue . Gina Silvers says the spell was just supposed to keep Chuck away from magic . Ida Perez ( Mama P ) asks if Rebecca got the Morbium seed back , saying that Chuck stole it . Rebecca promises Gina that they 'll get Chuck back . In the present , Kelly 's dad lets Kelly go to the Pluot Festival because they are sending his mother away to New York for treatment and he wants the family to be together . Ms. Silvers shows up at the Pluot festival , but wo n't get involved and advises Hannah to abandon her friends and run away to avoid the consequences . Jake and Hannah free Darbie , and mix a magic protection protein shake . At the Pluot Festival , Kelly refuses to drink the shake and pours it out . She gives her grandmother what she thinks is the last bite of the recipe , but it does nothing . Mama P goes on stage and tells off the town . Jake gives Kelly his shake , so she can be protected . Mama P eats the actual last bite , and the entire town freezes in place except for the girls and Mama P -- and Ms. Silvers . The two old women bicker about who is to blame . Mama P and Ms. Silvers tell the girls that Kelly 's grandmother is n't innocent either -- that after they cursed each other , she threw the book over a waterfall to get rid of it , in effect making their curses permanent . Mama P steals Jake 's bike to ride out of town , and Ms. Silvers leaves . The girls consult the book , which opens itself to a blank page , which the girls take to mean they need to create their own spell to break the curse . They go to Mama P 's ingredient room and realize that they need the properties of three different ingredient families , but mixing them would modify those properties , so they make a layer cake , with each layer producing its own effect . As they bake , the recipe magically appears in the book , in their handwriting . They name it Last Ditch Layer Cake . As the girls are about to serve the cake , Ms. Silvers shows up with ground Morbium root and tells the girls she was going to use it to break her own curse , but they need it to strengthen the spell . They express confidence in their work and say they do n't need it . They eat the cake , and the town starts up . In addition , Grandma is back to normal and Ms. Silvers plays piano on stage and everyone can hear her . Grandma tells them that she did n't want Kelly and the girls to be endangered by the book , but The Traveler said that the cookbook was no longer hers to give back , because it belonged to the girls . She tried to get rid of the book , tearing out the three pages , but the spell she cast backfired , and in effect she cursed herself . Grandma and Ms. Silvers realize that if their curses are broken , Chuck 's might be as well , and if he 's back , no one is safe . The Ferris Wheel stops , and a young man in a leather jacket with rolled up jeans steps off and walks away through the crowd , unnoticed .",

The new scale used a reference group of about one million seniors in the class of 1990 : the scale was designed so that the SAT scores of this cohort would have a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 110 . Because the new scale would not be directly comparable to the old scale , scores awarded on April 1995 and later were officially reported with an `` R '' ( for example , `` 560R '' ) to reflect the change in scale , a practice that was continued until 2001 . Scores awarded before April 1995 may be compared to those on the recentered scale by using official College Board tables .

In 1977 , Michel Ugon from Honeywell Bull invented the first microprocessor smart card with two chips : one microprocessor and one memory , and in 1978 , he patented the self - programmable one - chip microcomputer ( SPOM ) that defines the necessary architecture to program the chip . Three years later , Motorola used this patent in its `` CP8 '' . At that time , Bull had 1,200 patents related to smart cards . In 2001 , Bull sold its CP8 division together with its patents to Schlumberger , who subsequently combined its own internal smart card department and CP8 to create Axalto . In 2006 , Axalto and Gemplus , at the time the world 's top two smart - card manufacturers , merged and became Gemalto . In 2008 , Dexa Systems spun off from Schlumberger and acquired Enterprise Security Services business , which included the smart - card solutions division responsible for deploying the first large - scale smart - card management systems based on public key infrastructure ( PKI ) .",

In 1488 Bartolomeu Dias reached the Indian Ocean by this route . In 1492 the Catholic Monarchs of Castile and Aragon funded Christopher Columbus 's plan to sail west to reach the Indies by crossing the Atlantic . He landed on a continent uncharted by Europeans and seen as a new world , the Americas .

They favoured placing rich , ornate designs on the outside of skyscrapers at the ground level and simpler , plainer ornamentation on the upper levels , with strong vertical lines . The roofs of their skyscrapers typically formed a comprehensible outline and structure when seen at a distance as part of the city skyline . The intent was to draw the observer 's eye upwards , celebrating what Sullivan termed the `` lofty '' nature of the skyscraper , but not wasting resources on intricate detailing unlikely to appeal to a busy businessman . At the same time , the more lavish ground floor designs would make the building stand out to passers - by and pull in the necessary business for a successful commercial building .",

An example of a limiting factor is sunlight in the rain forest , where growth is limited to all plants on the forest floor unless more light becomes available . This decreases a number of potential factors that could influence a biological process , but only one is in effect at any one place and time . This recognition that there is always a single limiting factor is vital in ecology ; and the concept has parallels in numerous other processes . The limiting factor also causes competition between individuals of a species population . For example , space is a limiting factor . Many predators and prey need a certain amount of space for survival : food , water , and other biological needs . If the population of a species is too high , they start competing for those needs . Thus the limiting factors hold down population in an area by causing some individuals to seek better prospects elsewhere and others to stay and starve . Some other limiting factors in biology include temperature and other weather related factors . Species can also be limited by the availability of macro - and micronutrients . There has even been evidence of co-limitation in prairie ecosystems . A study published in 2017 showed that sodium ( a micronutrient ) had no effect on its own , but when in combination with nitrogen and phosphorus ( macronutrients ) , it did show positive effects , which is evidence of serial co-limitation .",

            "sentence": "The polar bear is a marine mammal because it spends many months of the year at sea . However , it is the only living marine mammal with powerful , large limbs and feet that allow them to cover miles on foot and run on land . Its preferred habitat is the annual sea ice covering the waters over the continental shelf and the Arctic inter-island archipelagos . These areas , known as the `` Arctic ring of life '' , have high biological productivity in comparison to the deep waters of the high Arctic . The polar bear tends to frequent areas where sea ice meets water , such as polynyas and leads ( temporary stretches of open water in Arctic ice ) , to hunt the seals that make up most of its diet . Freshwater is limited in these environments because it is either locked up in snow or saline . Polar bears are able to produce water through the metabolism of fats found in seal blubber . Polar bears are therefore found primarily along the perimeter of the polar ice pack , rather than in the Polar Basin close to the North Pole where the density of seals is low .",

A disadvantage of this method is that although thresholds can be obtained , results are not ear specific .

The term first appears in Latin in 1469 as media tempestas ( middle times ) . The term la rinascita ( rebirth ) first appeared , however , in its broad sense in Giorgio Vasari 's Lives of the Artists , 1550 , revised 1568 . Vasari divides the age into three phases : the first phase contains Cimabue , Giotto , and Arnolfo di Cambio ; the second phase contains Masaccio , Brunelleschi , and Donatello ; the third centers on Leonardo da Vinci and culminates with Michelangelo . It was not just the growing awareness of classical antiquity that drove this development , according to Vasari , but also the growing desire to study and imitate nature .",

Provisions that give rise to certain kinds of questions are seen to need additional provisions for how to resolve those questions , and provisions that offer no course of action may best be omitted and left to policy decisions .

            "sentence": "Game 7 was won by the home team in the 9 World Series between 1980 and 2013 that went to seven games ( the 1982 St. Louis Cardinals , 1985 Kansas City Royals , 1986 New York Mets , 1987 and 1991 Minnesota Twins , 1997 Florida Marlins , 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks , 2002 Anaheim Angels , and 2011 St. Louis Cardinals ) before the Giants won game 7 on the road in 2014 . This trend reverses the previous historical trend in which Game 7 had been most often won by the road team , in 1979 , 1975 , 1972 , 1971 , 1968 , 1967 , 1965 , and 1962 . During the 1960s and 1970s , the home team had won Game 7 only in 1960 , 1964 , and 1973 . Since 2003 , when home field advantage started to be awarded to the team representing the league that won the All - Star game , the first Series that reached Game 7 was in 2011 . The greatest comebacks in World Series history were in 1968 , when the Detroit Tigers came back from a 3 -- 1 game disadvantage to win Game 5 after being behind by 3 runs , before winning games 6 and 7 on the road at St. Louis , and 2016 , when the Chicago Cubs scored three runs to win Game 5 and won the last two games in Cleveland . The 1981 Los Angeles Dodgers are the last team to win a World Series after losing the first two games on the road ( against New York ) . The recent tendency of a team winning the first two games at home and then winning the Series suggests the theoretical advantage to gaining home - field advantage ( and the first two games at home ) . The Pittsburgh Pirates won all five of their World Series championships in seven games . The Minnesota Twins / Washington Senators won all three of their World Series championships in seven games . There have been 19 World Series four - game ( 4 -- 0 ) sweeps , the most recent of which occurred in 2012 . Nine different teams have swept a World Series at least once , the Yankees having done so most often ( 8 times ) . The Red Sox , Reds , and Giants have all done it twice . The Braves , Orioles , White Sox , Dodgers , and Athletics have each swept one Series . Six of these teams ( all but the Orioles , Red Sox and White Sox ) have also been swept 0 -- 4 in at least one World Series . The Red Sox ' two World Series sweeps are the most of any team that has never been swept in one . The Reds and Yankees are the only teams to have swept each other ( The Yankees swept the Reds in 1939 , while the Reds swept the Yankees in 1976 ) . The Giants are the only team to record World Series sweeps in two different cities : New York ( 1954 ) and San Francisco ( 2012 ) . The 1999 Yankees are the last team to date , and the only one since 1966 , to sweep a World Series it began on the road ( as well as the last American League champion to win a World Series it began on the road until the 2017 season when the Astros defeated the Dodgers in 7 games ) . The 1963 Dodgers are the last National League team to date to sweep a World Series it began on the road . The Athletics , Cardinals , Cubs , and Yankees are the only teams to be swept in two World Series . The Athletics and Yankees are the only two of these with at least one World Series sweep to their credit , the other two being among nine teams overall that have never swept a World Series , but have been swept in one ( the Tigers , Astros , Indians , Padres , Phillies , Pirates , and Rockies being the others ) . The Cubs in 1907 and the Giants in 1922 won 4 games to 0 , but each of those Series ' included a tied game and are not considered to be true sweeps . In 1907 , the first game was the tie and the Cubs won four straight after that . In 1922 , Game 2 was the tie . The Cincinnati Reds were the only National League team to sweep any World Series between 1963 and 2012 , sweeping their last two series appearances to date in 1976 and 1990 . When added to their Game 7 victory in 1975 , this means that the Reds have won their last 9 consecutive World Series games , making this the current longest winning streak in terms of consecutive World Series games won . Nine World Series have ended with `` walk - off '' hits , i.e. , that game and the Series ended when the home team won with a base hit in the bottom of the ninth or in extra innings : 1924 * , 1929 , 1935 , 1953 , 1960 * , 1991 * , 1993 , 1997 * , and 2001 * . Five of these ( marked with a * ) were in a deciding Game 7 . In addition , the deciding Game 8 ( one game had ended in a tie ) of the 1912 World Series ended in a walk - off sacrifice fly . Two men have ended a World Series with a walk - off home run : Bill Mazeroski in 1960 and Joe Carter in 1993 . Mazeroski 's was a solo shot in the bottom of the ninth of Game 7 to win a championship for the Pittsburgh Pirates , while Carter 's was a three - run shot in Game 6 that won a championship for the Toronto Blue Jays . There has been one World Series that ended on a runner caught stealing , on a play that involved three future Hall of Famers . In the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7 of the 1926 World Series , Babe Ruth of the New York Yankees tried to steal second base with two outs and his team trailing the St. Louis Cardinals 3 -- 2 . Ruth was thrown out by Cardinals catcher Bob O'Farrell after Bob Meusel swung at and missed a pitch from Grover Cleveland Alexander . St. Louis second baseman Rogers Hornsby applied the tag on Ruth , who in his career was successful on 51 % of his stolen base attempts . Ruth , Alexander and Hornsby were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame . One World Series game has ended with a pick - off of a runner . Kolten Wong of the St. Louis Cardinals was picked off of first base in Game 4 of the 2013 World Series by Boston Red Sox closer Koji Uehara . The score was 4 -- 2 and rookie Wong was a pinch runner . The Philadelphia Phillies and the Tampa Bay Rays are the first teams to have an elimination game ( or any game ) be suspended because of weather , and not have it cancelled . Game 5 ( in Philadelphia ) was suspended on Monday , October 27 , 2008 with a 2 -- 2 score , and resumed in the bottom of the sixth on Wednesday , October 29 . The Phillies went on to win the game and clinch the series . Both of the Minnesota Twins ' World Series titles since relocating to the Twin Cities from Washington , D.C. ( where they were the first Washington Senators ) were in 7 game series where all games were won by the home team . The Twins accomplished this in 1987 , when the Twins defeated the St. Louis Cardinals , then 4 years later in 1991 , when the Twins defeated the Atlanta Braves . The Twins victories in both series were in games 1 , 2 , 6 , and 7 , while their National League opponents won games 3 , 4 , and 5 . This same scenario also occurred in 2001 , when the Arizona Diamondbacks defeated the New York Yankees . Also of note when it comes to the three series where every game was won by the home team , a pitcher was MVP . In the 1987 World Series , Frank Viola was the MVP having pitched games 1 , 4 , and 7 , and finishing with a 2 -- 1 record . In 1991 , Jack Morris achieved the same feat pitching games 1 , 4 , and 7 with a 2 -- 0 record and a no decision in game 4 , and winning MVP honors . However , Morris 's MVP came on the heels of pitching 10 shutout innings in game 7 . Finally , in 2001 , Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson took MVP honors by being the reason the Arizona Diamondbacks were in position to win the series . The Boston Red Sox have lost 4 World Series , all in 7 games . ( 1946 , 1967 , 1975 , & 1986 ) Four World Series ended with teams clinching the championship in the final game of the series which was not a game 7 and went into extra innings . The title was won this way in 1939 , 1992 , 2012 , and 2015 , with the road team winning each time . The home team has not won a deciding game of a World Series since 2013 , and has not done so in four of the last six seasons .",

            "sentence": "The exact field goal range varies for each team , depending on the ability of the team 's placekicker . While some weaker placekickers may have trouble kicking field goals longer than 30 yards ( making field goals from beyond the 13 difficult ) , others may consistently make 50 - yarders , making it practical to kick from beyond the 33 . For most NFL kickers , the 35 - yard line is typically the limit of their field goal range . Weather conditions , particularly wind , also have a significant impact on field goal range ; kicking with the wind at the kicker 's back significantly increases field goal range , while kicking against the wind or with a stiff crosswind will greatly reduce the kicker 's effective range , while generally there is no advantage beyond assured targeting of a kick if a game is being played indoors . Altitude also affects kicking range ; both the longest punt in NFL history and three of the longest field goals in NFL history took place in Denver , Colorado , which is more than 4,000 feet ( 1,200 m ) higher in elevation than the next - highest NFL city ( the Phoenix suburb of Glendale , Arizona ) . From the 1970s through the 1990s , artificial turf improved a kicker 's field goal range by having less friction during the kick ; one of the reasons Scott Norwood missed the game - winning kick in Super Bowl XXV was that he kicked on artificial turf in Buffalo and struggled with longer field goals on natural grass throughout his career , and Super Bowl XXV was played on a grass surface . ( Modern artificial turf , which has similar depth and characteristics to natural grass , does not have an appreciable effect on kicking range . )",

Although often debated , most scholars agree that modern human behavior can be characterized by abstract thinking , planning depth , symbolic behavior ( e.g. , art , ornamentation , music ) , exploitation of large game , and blade technology , among others . Underlying these behaviors and technological innovations are cognitive and cultural foundations that have been documented experimentally and ethnographically . Some of these human universal patterns are cumulative cultural adaptation , social norms , language , and extensive help and cooperation beyond close kin . It has been argued that the development of these modern behavioral traits , in combination with the climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum , was largely responsible for the human replacement of Neanderthals and the peopling of the rest of the world .",

The extent of the region being claimed was vague at first , evolving over decades into the specific borders specified in the US - British treaty of 1818 . The U.S. - based its claim in part on Robert Gray 's entry of the Columbia River in 1792 and the Lewis and Clark Expedition . Great Britain based its claim in part on British overland explorations of the Columbia River by David Thompson and on prior discovery and exploration along the Coast . Spain 's claim was based on the Inter caetera and Treaty of Tordesillas of 1493 -- 94 , as well as explorations of the Pacific coast in the late 18th century . Russia based its claim off its explorations and trading activities in the region and asserted its ownership of the region north of the 51st parallel by the Ukase of 1821 , which was quickly challenged by the other powers and withdrawn to 54 \u00b0 40 \u2032 N by separate treaties with the US and Britain in 1824 and 1825 respectively . Spain gave up its claims of exclusivity via the Nootka Conventions of the 1790s . In the Nootka Conventions , which followed the Nootka Crisis Spain granted Britain rights to the Pacific Northwest , although it did not establish a northern boundary for Spanish California , nor did it extinguish Spanish rights to the Pacific Northwest . Spain later relinquished any remaining claims to territory north of the 42nd parallel to the United States as part of the Adams - On\u00eds Treaty of 1819 . In the 1820s , Russia gave up its claims south of 54 \u00b0 40 \u2032 and east of the 141st meridian in separate treaties with the United States and Britain .",

Freud was a neurologist trying to find an effective treatment for patients with neurotic or hysterical symptoms . Freud realised that there were mental processes that were not conscious , whilst he was employed as a neurological consultant at the Children 's Hospital , where he noticed that many aphasic children had no apparent organic cause for their symptoms . He then wrote a monograph about this subject . In 1885 , Freud obtained a grant to study with Jean - Martin Charcot , a famed neurologist , at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re in Paris , where Freud followed the clinical presentations of Charcot , particularly in the areas of hysteria , paralyses and the anaesthesias . Charcot had introduced hypnotism as an experimental research tool and developed the photographic representation of clinical symptoms .",

And , most of all , I want to thank him for being a part of the greatest 1 - 2 punch ever created , never to be duplicated .

'' He said the two had `` mutual respect '' for each other , while O'Neal commented that they had an `` athletic dislike '' for each other but `` never had a real dislike '' . That year , the Lakers retired O'Neal's No. 34 during a halftime ceremony . Bryant did not attend the ceremony , but called O'Neal `` the most gifted physical specimen I 've ever seen play this game '' in a recorded video during the event .

Specifically , the bill , now usually referred to as the Toleration Act , granted freedom of conscience to all Christians . ( The colony which became Rhode Island passed a series of laws , the first in 1636 , which prohibited religious persecution including against non-Trinitarians ; Rhode Island was also the first government to separate church and state . ) Historians argue that it helped inspire later legal protections for freedom of religion in the United States .

            "sentence": "The rate at which different qualities are detected in first impressions may be linked to what has been important to survival from an evolutionary perspective . For example , trustworthiness and attractiveness were the two traits most quickly detected and evaluated in a study of human faces . People are fairly good at assessing personality traits of others in general , but there appears to be a difference in first impression judgments between older and younger adults . Older adults judged young adult target photos as healthier , more trustworthy , and less hostile , but more aggressive , than younger adults did of the same photos . Older adults could have a lower response to negative cues due to a slower processing speed , causing them to see facial features on young adults as more positive than younger adults do .",

The player is a Grey Warden , part of an order of elite fighters , whose task is to defeat the Archdemon and save the world from a disastrous event called the Blight . Players create their own Grey Warden character , customizing gender and appearance as well as choosing a race and class . The available classes are warriors , who perform strong physical attacks ; rogues , who carry out stealth attacks and steal items from other characters ; and mages , who cast spells on enemies , create combo spells , and support other party members . The three choices of race are human , elf , and dwarf . The combination of class and race determines which of six different origin stories the player experiences : Dalish Elf , Dwarf Commoner , City Elf , Magi , Human Noble , or Dwarf Noble .

            "sentence": "Those unfamiliar to comics may assume that Iron Man 's first appearance is The Invincible Iron Man # 1 ( May 1968 ) . However , in the golden and early silver ages of comic books , few superheroes debuted in magazines carrying their names . More often a character first appeared in a generically titled anthology series . If the character proved popular , a new series was launched . For example , Iron Man first appeared in Tales of Suspense # 39 ( March 1963 ) and appeared regularly in that series for five years before Marvel launched a series properly named Iron Man . Wonder Woman , Spider - Man , The Mighty Thor and many others also first appeared in anthology series . The first appearance of `` all - star '' teams is given as the first instance in which that team banded together regardless of whether or not it consists of previously existing characters . The first appearance of The Justice League of America is considered The Brave and the Bold # 28 ( May 1960 ) , the issue in which they first operated as a group , although none of its members first appeared in that issue . Alternatively , X-Men # 1 ( September 1963 ) is both the first appearance of the X-Men and that of each of the team 's original members . Sometimes a character first appears in the last page of an issue , foreshadowing his or her greater role in the next issue . Arguments can ensue over whether the first appearance is the issue containing the final page cameo or the subsequent issue which more adequately introduced the character . Wolverine was first seen in the last page of The Incredible Hulk # 180 ( October 1974 ) but makes a more full appearance in issue # 181 ( November 1974 ) . Stricter fans may consider The Incredible Hulk # 180 Wolverine 's first appearance but most consider it # 181 . ComicsPriceGuide.com lists a copy of issue # 180 , rated very fine , at $149 and # 181 at $2,075 . Comparatively , The Incredible Hulk # 179 ( September 1974 ) , which has no special importance , is listed at $11 , so both types of first appearance add value to a comic book . Retconning can also complicate first appearances . Initially , Cable was portrayed as a wholly new character , first appearing in The New Mutants # 87 ( March 1990 ) . However , writers later changed his background , stating that Cable is an adult , time - traveling Nathan Summers , the son of Cyclops and Madelyne Pryor , first seen in Uncanny X-Men # 201 ( January 1986 ) . Both issues could be given as the first appearance of Cable . Further complicating the matter , Cable was seen in a cameo at the end of The New Mutants # 86 ( February 1990 ) . Some superhero identities are used by more than one character . The original Green Lantern first appeared in All - American Comics # 16 ( April 1940 ) . During the Silver Age , Green Lantern , like many DC heroes , was rebooted with a totally new identity . The second Green Lantern , Hal Jordan , debuted in Showcase # 22 ( October 1959 ) . All - American Comics # 16 is still considered the first appearance of Green Lantern , both of the original title - bearer and the superhero identity itself . To avoid confusion , Showcase # 22 is called the first appearance of Hal Jordan , of Green Lantern II or of the Silver Age Green Lantern . Occasionally , a character will appear in the background of a comic book before fully introduced . Spider - Man 's early love interest Liz Allan is first addressed by name in Amazing Spider - Man # 4 ( September 1963 ) . However , an unnamed character in Amazing Spider - Man # 1 ( March 1963 ) is , based on her appearance and dialogue , probably Allan . Plus , Amazing Fantasy # 15 ( August 1962 ) , shows an unnamed , unspeaking character who looks exactly like Allan . Thus Allan 's first appearance may be given as any of the three . Some characters appear in more than one continuity . While the first appearance of Nightcrawler is Giant - Size X-Men # 1 ( May 1975 ) , the first appearance of `` Ultimate Nightcrawler '' ( Nightcrawler in the alternate Ultimate Marvel universe ) is Ultimate X-Men # 6 ( August 2001 ) . Sometimes new characters are created for television or film adaptations of a franchise and are later added to the comic book continuity . The Batman adversary Harley Quinn debuted in the 1992 Batman : The Animated Series episode `` Joker 's Favor '' . Her first appearance in comic format was the graphic novel The Batman Adventures # 12 , which took place in the continuity of Batman : The Animated Series . Her first appearance in the regular `` DC Universe '' was the 1999 one - shot Batman : Harley Quinn . Thus her first appearance is technically Joker 's Favor , her first appearance in a comic book was The Batman Adventures # 12 and her first appearance in the regular DC Comics continuity was Batman : Harley Quinn . Similarly , Firestar first appeared in Spider - Man and His Amazing Friends # 1 , which adapted the first episode of the TV series . Her first Earth - 616 appearance was in The Uncanny X-Men # 193 . Rarely , a character debuts in a publisher 's foreign branch and then appears in a domestic series . Psylocke first appeared in Captain Britain # 8 ( December 1976 ) , an original series of Marvel UK not widely available outside Great Britain . Her debut in an American series was The New Mutants Annual # 2 ( 1986 ) . Her first appearance is sometimes given as either but more correctly it is Captain Britain # 8 while The New Mutants Annual # 2 is her first US appearance . Some characters appear first in a normal supporting role before becoming a superhero or villain . For example , Roderick Kingsley first appeared as a minor supporting character in The Spectacular Spider - Man # 43 ( June 1980 ) . However , he would later take on the villainous role of the Hobgoblin in The Amazing Spider - Man # 238 ( March 1983 ) , becoming one of Spider - Man 's most dangerous foes . The latter issue , featuring his first appearance as the Hobgoblin , is worth quite a bit more than his original debut .",

Hydrothermal vents are commonly found near volcanically active places , areas where tectonic plates are moving apart at spreading centers , ocean basins , and hotspots . Hydrothermal vents exist because the earth is both geologically active and has large amounts of water on its surface and within its crust . Common land types include hot springs , fumaroles and geysers . Under the sea , hydrothermal vents may form features called black smokers . Relative to the majority of the deep sea , the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents are biologically more productive , often hosting complex communities fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids . Chemosynthetic bacteria and archaea form the base of the food chain , supporting diverse organisms , including giant tube worms , clams , limpets and shrimp . Active hydrothermal vents are believed to exist on Jupiter 's moon Europa , and Saturn 's moon Enceladus , and it is speculated that ancient hydrothermal vents once existed on Mars .",

The New York Stock Exchange reopened that day following a nearly four - and - a-half - month closure since July 30 , 1914 , and the Dow in fact rose several percent that day ( from 71.42 to 74.56 , or + 4.4 % ) .

's absence , and the eventual death of the sun ( which Max had talked to Carol about earlier in the film ) . When Carol gets angry with Max for not doing a good job as a king , Douglas tries to explain to him that he 's `` just a boy , pretending to be a wolf , pretending to be a king '' , thus exposing the truth to the rest of the Wild Things . Carol becomes enraged and ends up ripping off Douglas 's right arm ( though only sand pours out of the wound ) . Then he chases Max into the forest and attempts to eat him . Max is saved by K.W. , who hides him in her stomach . Max listens as Carol and K.W. have an argument over Carol 's misbehavior . Max finds the crushed remains of Carol 's model island ( presumably destroyed by Carol himself in a rage ) and leaves a token of affection for him to find ( a letter C inside a love heart made of twigs ) . He finds Carol and tells him he is going home because he is not a king . The other Wild Things escort Max to his boat . Carol runs to join them after finding Max 's token and arrives in time to see him off . He starts to howl and Max howls back , then all the other Wild Things join in .

Zibrt writes that when he published this traditional story in 1894 in Narodni Listy newspaper , he received a good deal of feedback from eyewitnesses . In particular , he wrote that according to further witness , the originating event actually happened in 1830 , in Kostelec nad Labem , where she worked as a housemaid . Z\u00edbrt writes that he published the first version of the story ( with incorrect place name ) in Bohemia ( June 5 , 1844 ) , from where it was reprinted all over Europe and in the United States . Z\u00edbrt also wrote that simple Czech folk claimed that they knew and danced Polka long before the nobles got hold of it , i.e. , it is a truly folk Czech dance .",

Composers such as Debussy and Strauss found differing ways of stretching the limits of the tonal system in order to accommodate their ideas . After a brief period of free atonality , Arnold Schoenberg and others began exploring tone rows , in which an ordering of the twelve pitches of the equal tempered chromatic scale is used as the source material of a composition . This ordered set , often called a row , allowed for new forms of expression and ( unlike free atonality ) the expansion of underlying structural organizing principles without recourse to common practice harmony ( Delahoyde n.d. ) .",

'' As Real Steel was not based on a toy , Meyer said that `` there was no guideline '' for the robots , and each was designed from scratch , with an attempt to put `` different personality and aesthetics , '' according to Levy . In Atom 's case , it tried to have a more humanizing design to be an `` everyman '' who could attract the audience 's sympathy and serve as a proxy to the viewer , with a fencing mask that Meyer explained served to show `` his identity was a bit hidden , so you have to work harder to get to see him .

This causes the plant to have elongated cells on the farthest side from the light . Phototropism is one of the many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli . Growth towards a light source is called positive phototropism , while growth away from light is called negative phototropism ( skototropism ) . Most plant shoots exhibit positive phototropism , and rearrange their chloroplasts in the leaves to maximize photosynthetic energy and promote growth . Roots usually exhibit negative phototropism , although gravitropism may play a larger role in root behavior and growth .

In 2009 , details of Cave 's ultimately - rejected script surfaced on the internet : the script having Maximus being reincarnated by the Roman gods and returned to Rome to defend Christians against persecution ; then transported to other important periods in history , including World War II , the Vietnam War , and finally being a general in the modern - day Pentagon . This script for a sequel , however , was rejected as being too far - fetched , and not in keeping with the spirit and theme of the original film .",

His relationship with Tom was prickly at first ; but it mellowed into a slightly awkward marriage of convenience , with Barnaby still disapproving of Scott 's methods and Scott grudgingly starting to respect Barnaby . In `` The Straw Woman '' , Scott develops a love interest who is brutally murdered . The episode is notable for Barnaby 's lack of sympathy for Scott . Scott 's departure from the show was abrupt . In `` The House in the Woods '' , Barnaby describes Scott as having called him to say he was sick and thus unable to come to work . Barnaby invites Ben Jones to assist him on that case . After this incident , no more is heard from Scott , and Jones becomes the new deputy .",

A rising political consciousness among the native Indian social elite ( including lawyers , doctors , university graduates , government officials and similar groups ) spawned an Indian identity and fed a growing nationalist sentiment in India in the last decades of the nineteenth century . The creation in 1885 of the Indian National Congress in India by the political reformer A.O. Hume intensified the process by providing an important platform from which demands could be made for political liberalisation , increased autonomy , and social reform . The leaders of the Congress advocated dialogue and debate with the Raj administration to achieve their political goals .

            "sentence": "Mad magazine republished the original version of the poem in the 1950s with artwork by Jack Davis and no alterations to the text . Later lampoons in Mad included `` ' Cool ' Casey at the Bat '' ( 1960 ) , an interpretation of the poem in beatnik style , with artwork by Don Martin ; `` Casey at the Dice '' in 1969 , about a professional gambler ; `` Casey at the Talks '' in 1977 , a `` modern '' version of the famed poem in which Mudville tries unsuccessfully to sign free agent Casey ( the last line of which is `` Mighty Casey has held out '' ) ; `` Baseball at the Bat '' , a satire on baseball itself , `` Howard at the Mike '' , about Howard Stern ; `` Casey at the Byte '' ( 1985 ) , a tale of a cocky young computer expert who accidentally erases the White House Budget Plan ; `` Clooney as the Bat '' , a mockery of George Clooney 's role as Batman in Batman and Robin ; and in 2006 as `` Barry at the Bat '' , poking fun at Barry Bonds ' alleged involvement in the BALCO scandal , and in 2001 , `` Jordan at the Hoop '' , satirizing Michael Jordan 's return to the NBA and his time with the Washington Wizards . Another parody is set in the USSR , and ends with `` Kasey '' in a gulag prison . A `` Poetry Round Robin '' where famous poems are rewritten in the style of the next poet in line , featured Casey at the Bat as written by Edgar Allan Poe . Foster Brooks ( `` the Lovable Lush '' ) wrote `` Riley on the Mound '' , which recounts the story from the pitcher 's perspective . ( 1 ) Radio performer Garrison Keillor 's parodic version of the poem reimagines the game as a road game , instead of a home game , for the Mudville team . The same events occur with Casey striking out in the ninth inning as in the original poem , but with everything told from the perspective of other team . An episode of Tiny Toon Adventures featured a short titled `` Buster at the Bat '' , where Sylvester provides narration as Buster goes up to bat . The poem was parodied again for an episode of Animaniacs , this time with Wakko as the title character and Yakko narrating . In The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron : Boy Genius episode `` Return of the Nanobots '' , Cindy 's poem is identical to the ending of `` Casey at the Bat '' but replaces Mudville with Retroville and the last famed line with `` cause Jimmy is an idiot ! '' An episode of the show U.S. Acres was titled `` Orson at the Bat '' . The New York Times published a parody by Hart Seely and Frank Cammuso in which the poem was narrated by Phil Rizzuto , a New York Yankees announcer who was known to veer off on tangents while calling the game . The poem was later published in Seely and Cammuso 's book , 2007 Eleven And Other American Comedies . Issue # 92 of the comic Fables employs a paraphrased version of `` Casey at the Bat '' appropriating the character names to those of the Fable players . It is preceded by a mock apology to Ernest Thayer for the mangling of `` his beloved poem '' . David Pogue penned a parody version titled ' A Desktop Critic : Steven Saves the Mac ' for Macworld magazine that ran in their October 1999 issue . It tells the story of Steve Jobs ' triumphant return to a struggling Apple Inc and his early efforts to reverse the company 's fortunes . Dick Flavin wrote a version titled Teddy at the Bat , after Boston Red Sox legend Ted Williams died in July , 2002 . Flavin performed the poem at Fenway Park during the night - long tribute to Williams done at the park later that month . The poem replaced Flynn and Blake with Bobby Doerr and Johnny Pesky , the batters who preceded Williams in the 1946 Red Sox lineup . In 2000 , Michael J. Farrand adapted the rhyming scheme , tone , and theme of the poem -- while reversing the outcome -- to create his poem `` The Man Who Gave All the Dreamers in Baseball Land Bigger Dreams to Dream '' about Kirk Gibson 's home run off Dennis Eckersley in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series . The poem appears at the Baseball Almanac . Norman Jackman wrote a reversed - outcome version in 1951 called `` Bobby Thomson at the Bat , '' which went unknown for over 60 years until the San Francisco Giants published it in 2012 . It 's about Thomson 's famous home run in a 1951 Giant - Dodger playoff game . In 2016 , the poem was accepted into the poetry files of the National Baseball Library and Archive of the Hall of Fame . New York Times best - selling author and poet laureate of The Ringer , Shea Serrano , penned a loving tribute to NBA player Gordon Hayward in the vein of `` Casey at the Bat '' in 2017 . Canadian comedy duo Wayne and Shuster created `` Shakespearean Baseball '' , featuring William Shakespeare-esque characters and dialogue in a skit based upon the poem . They performed the play on The Ed Sullivan Show and on Canadian TV numerous times between the 1950s and 1980s . Following the Kansas City Royals ' magical run to the World Series in 2014 , which ended in the bottom of the ninth of Game Seven with the tying run on third and All - Star ( and the following year 's World Series MVP ) Salvador P\u00e9rez at the plate , KCUR - FM contributor Victor Wishna penned and recorded `` KC at the Brink , '' an `` Ode to the Kansas City Royals , '' which aired November 6 , 2014 .",

            "sentence": "It was in the 17th century that the concept of `` religion '' received its modern shape despite the fact that ancient texts like the Bible , the Quran , and other sacred texts did not have a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written . In the 19th century , Max M\u00fcller noted that what is called ancient religion today , would have been called `` law '' in antiquity . For example , there is no precise equivalent of `` religion '' in Hebrew , and Judaism does not distinguish clearly between religious , national , racial , or ethnic identities . The Sanskrit word `` dharma '' , sometimes translated as `` religion '' , also means law or duty . Throughout classical South Asia , the study of law consisted of concepts such as penance through piety and ceremonial as well as practical traditions . Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between `` imperial law '' and universal or `` Buddha law '' , but these later became independent sources of power . Throughout its long history , Japan had no concept of `` religion '' since there was no corresponding Japanese word , nor anything close to its meaning , but when American warships appeared off the coast of Japan in 1853 and forced the Japanese government to sign treaties demanding , among other things , freedom of religion , the country had to contend with this Western idea .",

The Hebrew word for the white stork is chasidah ( \u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4 ) , meaning `` merciful '' or `` kind '' . Greek and Roman mythology portray storks as models of parental devotion , and it was believed that they did not die of old age , but flew to islands and took the appearance of humans . The bird is featured in at least three of Aesop 's Fables : The Fox and the Stork , The Farmer and the Stork , and The Frogs Who Desired a King . Storks were also thought to care for their aged parents , feeding them and even transporting them , and children 's books depicted them as a model of filial values . A Greek law called Pelargonia , from the Ancient Greek word pelargos for stork , required citizens to take care of their aged parents . The Greeks also held that killing a stork could be punished with death . It was allegedly protected in Ancient Thessaly as it hunted snakes , and widely held to be Virgil 's `` white bird '' . Roman writers noted the white stork 's arrival in spring , which alerted farmers to plant their vines .",

As the music progresses , the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale . Music can be transposed from one scale to another for various purposes , often to accommodate the range of a vocalist . Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range , but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale . For example , transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a whole tone . Since the interval relationships remain unchanged , transposition may be unnoticed by a listener , however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch range compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music .

This is not to be confused with the amount of alcohol measured on the breath , as with a breathalyzer . The amount of alcohol measured on the breath is generally accepted as proportional to the amount of alcohol present in the blood at a rate of 1 : 2100 . Therefore , a breathalyzer measurement of 0.10 mg / L of breath alcohol converts to 0.0001 \u00d7 2100 g / 10dL , or 0.021 g / dL of blood alcohol ( the units of the BAC in the United States ) .

Daedalus tried his wings first , but before trying to escape the island , he warned his son not to fly too close to the sun , nor too close to the sea , but to follow his path of flight . Overcome by the giddiness that flying lent him , Icarus soared into the sky , but in the process he came too close to the sun , which due to the heat melted the wax . Icarus kept flapping his wings but soon realized that he had no feathers left and that he was only flapping his bare arms , and so Icarus fell into the sea in the area which today bears his name , the Icarian Sea near Icaria , an island southwest of Samos .",

            "sentence": "The famous order `` Do n't fire until you see the whites of their eyes '' was popularized in stories about the battle of Bunker Hill . It is uncertain as to who said it there , since various histories , including eyewitness accounts , attribute it to Putnam , Stark , Prescott , or Gridley , and it may have been said first by one , and repeated by the others . It was also not an original statement . The idea dates originally to the general - king Gustavus Adolphus ( 1594 -- 1632 ) who gave standing orders to his musketeers : `` never to give fire , till they could see their own image in the pupil of their enemy 's eye '' . Gustavus Adolphus 's military teachings were widely admired and imitated and caused this saying to be often repeated . It was used by General James Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham , when his troops defeated Montcalm 's army on September 13 , 1759 . The earliest similar quote came from the Battle of Dettingen on June 27 , 1743 , where Lieutenant - Colonel Sir Andrew Agnew of Lochnaw warned his Regiment , the Royal Scots Fusiliers , not to fire until they could `` see the white of their e'en . '' The phrase was also used by Prince Charles of Prussia in 1745 , and repeated in 1755 by Frederick the Great , and may have been mentioned in histories the colonial military leaders were familiar with . Whether or not it was actually said in this battle , it was clear that the colonial military leadership were regularly reminding their troops to hold their fire until the moment when it would have the greatest effect , especially in situations where their ammunition would be limited .",

'' She replied that she was `` not going anywhere '' , Coal Valley was where she belonged before they share a kiss . In season 2 , Elizabeth and Jack share a hot - and - cold relationship until the finale , `` With All My Heart . '' They both admit that they love each other and share another kiss . Jack 's brother , Tom , is introduced season 2 's `` Trials of the Heart , '' and their rocky relationship continues until `` Coming Together , Coming Apart . '' Jack gently reminds his younger brother how their father was so proud of him , but he would n't be proud of the way he was currently living .

She was briefly engaged to Jack Thornton , but they both realized that it would n't work out . Rosie immediately disliked Elizabeth and viewed her as `` the competition , '' but eventually came to really care about Elizabeth , even if she has a hard time showing it . At the beginning of season 2 , Rosemary began working at the cafe with Abigail and the two quickly became friends . Spending time with Abigail helped tone down some of Rosemary 's enthusiasm and made her a more likable person . Rosemary even came to like Elizabeth , even if only on an acquaintance level . Truthfully , she cares about everyone in Hope Valley , especially Lee , with whom she shares an mutual attraction . When Rosie is not spending time with Lee , talking to Abigail , or dreaming about the glamorous life of an actress , she can often be found somewhere writing her weekly advice column for Hope Valley 's newspaper ! In season 3 , Rosemary 's friendship with Elizabeth deepened . Instead of viewing her as an adversary , she finds a friend in Elizabeth . Throughout season 3 , Rosemary 's relationship with Lee becomes more romantic . In `` Heart Of A Hero , '' seeing that Lee needs to spend more time at the sawmill to help the new settlers find jobs , Rosemary tells Lee that the theatre does n't have to be built .

'' The couple shares in their first kiss . In `` A Gentle Heart , '' Lee is injured . Thinking he is asleep , Rosemary pours out her heart to him , telling how much she loves him . In `` Heartbreak , '' Rosemary is offered a job in Hollywood filming . This has always been Rosemary 's dream , to be an actress . Lee unselfishly tells her to do whatever she feels best , but it is obvious that the thought of her leaving Hope Valley hurts him . Rosemary considers her options and realizes that her place is in Hope Valley , with Lee . Lee then tells her that he has another `` role '' that he thinks would be perfect for her and proposes marriage . She happily accepts . In `` Hearts In Question , '' Rosemary enthusiastically plans for their wedding . The couple weds in the season 3 finale `` Prayers From The Heart , '' with Elizabeth and Abigail as her maids of honor . Leland `` Lee '' Coulter is a kind , laidback , patient man who opens a sawmill in Hope Valley . When timber becomes Coal Valley 's major source of natural resources , the town is renamed Hope Valley . He shares a mutual attraction to Rosemary and proves to be one of the few people who can outwit her . When she declines his romantic intentions , Lee recruits his friend , Molly Sullivan , to make Rosemary jealous ; the ploy succeeds and Rosemary accepts his suit , appreciating Lee 's good qualities . Despite her dramatic and occasionally prickly personality , Lee 's compassion and patience never fails with her . With Rosemary 's help , Lee beat Mr. Gowen at his own game in `` Heart and Home . '' When not at work , Lee enjoys being with friends , including Jack Thornton , who shares Lee 's simple and laidback outlook , allowing the men to discuss their lives and exchange romantic advice . In season 3 , Lee 's mill is unfortunately sabotaged by a man inside . Through Bill and Jack 's investigation , they find the culprit . In season 3 's `` Heart Of A Hero , '' Rosemary unselfishly gives up the theatre that Lee promised to build her . Lee promises that one day , he will build her the theatre at a time when he is n't so involved with the sawmill and finding people jobs . In `` A Gentle Heart , '' Lee is injured . Thinking Lee is asleep , Rosemary pours out her heart to Lee , telling him how afraid she was when she heard he had been injured . He however hears each and every word . She told him how much she loves him and to never leave her . In the episode `` Heartbreak , '' Lee thinks Rosemary may leave Hope Valley when she is offered a movie job in Hollywood . When she gives up the movie , seeing her future in Hope Valley with him , he asks her to marry him . The couple weds in the season 3 finale , `` Prayers From The Heart . '' Jack serves the role of Lee 's best man . Julie Thatcher is Elizabeth 's hopeless romantic younger sister . She often gets herself into sticky situations by falling head over heels for men who are n't quite what they seem . In season 2 she gets involved with Jack 's brother Tom , which causes trouble with her family and for Jack and Elizabeth 's relationship . Cat Montgomery is a kind , encouraging woman in Coal Valley . She is a widow and mother of three : Gabe , Miles , and Emily . Cat was one of the first mothers to show kindness to Elizabeth when she first came . She desperately wants her children to remember the good memories of their father as seen by her self - sacrificing acts in `` Secrets and Lies . '' Possessing a great sense of teamwork and encouragement , Cat supports the women of Coal Valley while working in the mines in `` Cease and Desist . '' She is good friends with Elizabeth and Abigail . In `` These Games , '' she also helps Jack catch a thief . Florence Blakeley is a feisty gossip in Hope Valley . She often has a pessimistic perspective and always seems to find the negative , even in a very positive situation . In `` Heart and Home , '' Abigail told Florence what she really thought about her , which causes Florence to rein in her negativity somewhat , though she remains fairly outspoken . While not always likable , Florence adds spice to life in Hope Valley . Molly Sullivan is a friend of Lee Coulter and Elizabeth Thatcher . Molly 's husband was killed in the mine disaster . She has a daughter Rosaleen . In season 1 's `` A Telling Silence , '' Rosaleen has trouble in school because she misses her father so much . When she runs away , Elizabeth finds her in the mine , feeling guilty that she did n't bring her father his lunch the day of the disaster because she wanted to play with a friend instead . She fears her mother will blame her , but Elizabeth convinces her that Molly will `` say that she loves her more than life itself . '' Molly is reunited with her daughter , to the joy of the town 's people . In season 2 's `` With All My Heart , '' Lee feels it 's time to `` play hard to get '' with Rosemary , so he enlists help from Molly . She pretends to be interested in him romantically . This ploy works and Rosemary admits that she does in fact like him . Molly is a kind woman and was among the first to welcome Elizabeth to town . Clara Stanton is the wife of Abigail 's late son Peter , and is a sweet , quiet , and sensitive young woman . Abigail never knew she had a daughter - in - law until season 2 's `` Trials of the Heart ; '' with Peter having married Clara only three days before he was killed . In `` Heart 's Desire , '' Abigail invites Clara to come live with her in Hope Valley , an offer that Clara accepts . Charles Kensington III is an old friend of Elizabeth with whom she reconnects while in Hamilton . He is interested in her , though her feelings for Jack get in the way of their relationship .",

Rear Admiral Alexander Duff , head of the Antisubmarine Division , suggested it on 26 April , and the First Sea Lord , Admiral John Jellicoe , approved it the next day . Escorts were to be composed of obsolete cruisers , armed merchant cruisers and pre-dreadnought battleships for the oceanic portion of the routes , while in the more dangerous waters around Britain they were composed of destroyers . Observation balloons , especially kytoons , were used to help spot submarines beneath the surface , the aircraft carrier not then being developed . During discussions in March , it was determined that 75 destroyers were needed , but only 43 were available . The first experimental convoy of merchant vessels left Gibraltar on 10 May 1917 and arrived at the Downs on 22 May , having been accompanied by the last leg of its journey by a flying boat from the Scillies .",

Olivia 's father Martin Olson was an acquaintance of Ward , and Olivia was encouraged to audition for Adventure Time after Ward told her father that he wanted `` her as a voice '' on his show . She had originally auditioned for the role of Princess Bubblegum . After her initial audition , she was asked to read for the role of Marceline , and was `` definitely impressed by the character '' after seeing design drawings . Martin Olson later noted that Olivia 's audition was a `` sham '' to please the network executives because Ward had already wanted her to be a voice on the show . In order to get into character , Olson often dresses in a manner similar to Marceline when she records her lines ; she explained , `` I always find ... that on the days that I go in to record Marceline , I 'll dress like her , in a weird way ... I 'll throw on some rock n ' roll boots , maybe some red lipstick , and just go in there . '' Olson also is the character 's singing voice . According to storyboard artist Cole Sanchez , composers Casey James Basichis and Tim Kiefer produce the bass music that the character performs in the series . Many of the songs written for Marceline were uploaded onto the internet by the writers as well as the production company . For instance , Rob Sugar -- the father of former storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar -- often uploaded demos of songs written for Marceline by Rebecca . Furthermore , Frederator also posted demos , as well as a full version of the popular `` Fry Song '' , sung by Marceline in the episode `` It Came from the Nightosphere '' , on its official blog . In flashback sequences , younger Marceline is voiced by Ava Acres . In the fifth season episodes `` Finn the Human '' / `` Jake the Dog '' , an older , alternate universe version of the character is voiced by Cloris Leachman . Martin Olson also provides the voice for Marceline 's demonic father Hunson Abadeer . Olivia Olson later noted that the opportunity to voice act with her father was `` pretty cool '' .",

As the majority of World War II had been fought far from its national boundaries , the United States had not suffered the industrial destruction nor massive civilian casualties that marked the wartime situation of the countries in Europe or Asia . The war had reinforced the position of the United States as the world 's largest long - term creditor nation and its principal supplier of goods ; moreover it had built up a strong industrial and technological infrastructure that had greatly advanced its military strength into a primary position on the global stage . Despite attempts to create multinational coalitions or legislative bodies ( such as the United Nations ) , it became increasingly clear that the superpowers had very different visions about what the post-war world ought to look like , and after the withdrawal of British aid to Greece in 1947 , the United States took the lead in containing Soviet expansion in the Cold War .",

            "sentence": "The necessary and proper clause has been interpreted extremely broadly , thereby giving Congress wide latitude in legislation . The first landmark case involving the clause was McCulloch v. Maryland ( 1819 ) , which involved the establishment of a national bank . Alexander Hamilton , in advocating the creation of the bank , argued that there was `` a more or less direct '' relationship between the bank and `` the powers of collecting taxes , borrowing money , regulating trade between the states , and raising and maintaining fleets and navies '' . Thomas Jefferson countered that Congress 's powers `` can all be carried into execution without a national bank . A bank therefore is not necessary , and consequently not authorized by this phrase '' . Chief Justice John Marshall agreed with the former interpretation . Marshall wrote that a Constitution listing all of Congress 's powers `` would partake of a prolixity of a legal code and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind '' . Since the Constitution could not possibly enumerate the `` minor ingredients '' of the powers of Congress , Marshall `` deduced '' that Congress had the authority to establish a bank from the `` great outlines '' of the general welfare , commerce and other clauses . Under this doctrine of the necessary and proper clause , Congress has sweepingly broad powers ( known as implied powers ) not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution . However , the Congress can not enact laws solely on the implied powers , any action must be necessary and proper in the execution of the enumerated powers .",

Work on the White Tower -- which gives the whole castle its name -- is usually considered to have begun in 1078 , however the exact date is uncertain . William made Gundulf , Bishop of Rochester , responsible for its construction , although it may not have been completed until after William 's death in 1087 . The White Tower is the earliest stone keep in England , and was the strongest point of the early castle . It also contained grand accommodation for the king . At the latest , it was probably finished by 1100 when Bishop Ranulf Flambard was imprisoned there . Flambard was loathed by the English for exacting harsh taxes . Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower , he was also the first person to escape from it , using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine . He was held in luxury and permitted servants , but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors . After plying them with drink , when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber , and out of the Tower . The escape came as such a surprise that one contemporary chronicler accused the bishop of witchcraft .",

            "sentence": "Contrary to popular belief , since the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 , not all states specifically prohibit minors ' and young adults ' consumption of alcohol in private settings . That is because the federal law is concerned only with purchase and public possession , not private consumption , and contains several exceptions . As of January 1 , 2007 , 14 states and the District of Columbia ban underage consumption outright , 19 states do not specifically ban underage consumption outright , and 17 states have family member or location exceptions to their underage consumption laws . Federal law explicitly provides for religious , medical , employment and private club possession exceptions ; as of 2005 , 31 states have family member or location exceptions to their underage possession laws . In the 1960s the age for buying or drinking beer and wine in the District of Columbia ( Washington , D.C. ) was 18 ; the age for hard liquor was 21 . Residents from Virginia and Maryland would often drive to D.C. to obtain alcohol . In Louisiana , the 1987 law raising the age from 18 to 21 was deliberately written solely to comply with the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 to avoid losing highway funding , while still allowing 18 - to 20 - year - olds to drink as before . Not only did it still allow 18 - to 20 - year - olds to consume in private , it contained a major loophole allowing bars and stores to sell alcohol to 18 - to 20 - year - olds without penalty ( despite purchase being technically illegal ) which meant that the de facto age was still 18 . In other words , the drinking age was 21 only on paper . This loophole was closed in 1995 , but in 1996 the Louisiana Supreme Court declared a drinking age of 21 unconstitutional . That briefly lowered the de jure purchase age to 18 , causing an uproar which prompted the Louisiana Supreme Court to reverse its decision , raising the age to 21 three months later . Other exceptions still remain to this day , including drinking in a private residence , and Louisiana still has some of the most liberal general alcohol laws of any state . Some states were `` dry '' well before national Prohibition was enacted in 1919 , in some cases since achieving statehood . Also , some states did not become fully `` wet '' until several years after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933 ( e.g. Mississippi in 1966 ) . Since 1966 , all states and territories of the USA have been `` wet '' , but dry counties and towns still exist in some states .",

Edward and Alphonse ambush and successfully capture their target . However , due to Edward being enraged by McDougal calling him `` small '' , the `` Freezing Alchemist '' finds an opening and escapes . The Elric brothers alongside the state military are forced to confront McDougal again when he simultaneously activates numerous transmutation circles in Central , which creates an alchemic reaction encompassing the entire command center . Edward suspects the use of a philosopher 's stone , but is unable to confirm his suspicion . Luckily , the Elric brothers , Major Alex Louis Armstrong , and Mustang succeed in thwarting McDougal 's plans to bury Central in ice . The F\u00fchrer confronts McDougal as he attempts to escape . In the brief battle that follows , McDougal is easily sliced to death by the F\u00fchrer , who later credits both Mustang and the Elric brothers in helping accomplish the mission . 02 `` The First Day '' `` Hajimari no Hi '' ( \u306f\u3058\u307e\u308a \u306e \u65e5 ) April 12 , 2009 February 20 , 2010 As Edward and Alphonse depart for Liore by train , their childhood is shown in flashback . They had learned rudimentary alchemy from their father 's books , and , upon their mother 's death , had attempted to revive her by performing human transmutation , a practice officially considered taboo among alchemists . A dark mass of shadowy hands then proceeded to disintegrate Alphonse 's physical body , while a disembodied figure named Truth showed Edward the secret behind perfect human transmutation in exchange for his left leg . Cursing his actions in causing the loss of his brother , Edward bonds Alphonse 's soul to a suit of armor , sacrificing his right arm to complete the process . Elsewhere in the present , Colonel Maes Hughes shows Mustang the paperwork concerning the McDougal incident , which states that McDougal used a Xingese art known as alkahestry , unknown to the two of them . Back in the past , Edward 's skill in both surviving the attempted human transmutation and anchoring his brother 's soul attracts the attention of Mustang , who suggests Edward become a state alchemist . Edward later takes and passes the state alchemist examination , and is given the title of `` Fullmetal Alchemist '' . 03 `` City of Heresy '' `` Jaky\u014d no Machi '' ( \u90aa\u6559 \u306e \u8857 ) April 19 , 2009 February 27 , 2010 Edward and Alphonse arrive at Liore , where they witness Father Cornello winning the devotion of the townspeople by performing `` miraculous '' transmutations , which they believe could only have been accomplished using a philosopher 's stone . They meet Ros\u00e9 and request to see Cornello , who is aware of the state alchemists ' presence . Cornello ambushes Edward and Alphonse , sending a chimera , a hybrid , after them . While battling the chimera , Edward unintentionally reveals his prosthetic automail limbs , making Cornello realize that he had attempted the forbidden taboo of human transmutation . Edward and Alphonse escape , taking Ros\u00e9 with them . While Alphonse explains their story to Ros\u00e9 , Cornello finds Edward and reveals his nefarious plan , unaware that it had been broadcast to the whole town of Liore . Cornello uses the philosopher 's stone on his ring to fight against Edward , but Edward manages to defeat him . Edward then realizes that the stone is a fake when it shatters on the ground . Cornello runs off , but is killed by Lust and eaten by Gluttony . When Ros\u00e9 confronts Edward and Alphonse about the stone , despairing that she had believed in Cornello for nothing , Edward tells her to find strength within herself and to `` walk on her own two feet '' . 04 `` An Alchemist 's Anguish '' `` Renkinjutsushi no Kun\u014d '' ( \u932c\u91d1\u8853 \u5e2b \u306e \u82e6\u60a9 ) April 26 , 2009 March 6 , 2010 A mysterious man with a cross-shaped scar across his face attacks and murders Brigadier General Basque Grand . The F\u00fchrer orders Hughes and Armstrong to use all available resources to stop the murderer . Meanwhile , to avoid being in their debt , Mustang introduces Edward and Alphonse to Shou Tucker , the `` Sewing - Life Alchemist '' , who obtained his state alchemist credentials by creating a chimera that could understand human speech . He opens up his library to the Elric brothers for them to study living creature transmutation , but they also end up spending time to play with Tucker 's daughter Nina and family dog Alexander . Upon returning to the house for another study session , they find that Tucker has created another speaking chimera in order to satisfy his yearly assessment requirements . However , Edward is furious to discover that the speaking chimera was created using Nina and Alexander , and he also realizes that Tucker did the same with his wife , two years prior . Alphonse stops Edward from nearly beating Tucker to death , as Edward is left feeling helpless . Mustang tells him that by being a state alchemist , he must prepare himself to take a life if called upon by the military . While Tucker is arrested for his actions , he is visited by the scarred man , who kills him , and then delivers a mercy killing to the Nina / Alexander chimera . 05 `` Rain of Sorrows '' `` Kanashimi no Ame '' ( \u54c0\u3057\u307f \u306e \u96e8 ) May 3 , 2009 March 13 , 2010 Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye tells Edward and Alphonse that both Tucker and the chimera have been killed . Meanwhile , back in Liore , Lust and Gluttony attempt to cause a rebellion using the faith of the locals , with Envy using his shape - shifting powers to disguise himself as Cornello . Back at East City , as Edward and Alphonse dwell on their limits in alchemy , they are viciously attacked by Scar . They quickly retreat until they are cornered and are forced to defend themselves , resulting in Scar damaging Alphonse 's body and then destroying Edward 's right arm . The state alchemists intervene just when Scar prepares to finish off Edward . Mustang , unable to subdue Scar , is saved by Hawkeye , who reminds Mustang that his flame alchemy is useless in the rain .

Deciding not to mention anything incriminating , they speak of their search for May , leading Olivier to be interested in alkahestry . They are given work to do by Major Miles , who is part Ishvalan , and they also run into Falman . Suddenly , the homunculus named Sloth appears from underground , and Olivier is surprised by his invulnerability . Edward has to hold back his answers about the homunculus , only mentioning that its makeup is similar to that of a human , which gives Olivier an idea on how to detain it . 35 `` The Shape of This Country '' `` Kono Kuni no Katachi '' ( \u3053\u306e \u56fd \u306e \u304b\u305f\u3061 ) December 6 , 2009 March 5 , 2011 Olivier and her crew manage to subdue Sloth by dousing him in fuel and sending him outside to freeze .

Meanwhile , Marcoh continues to look into alkahestry , with May teaching him about how it works . Edward , Alphonse , Olivier , Buccaneer , and Falman investigate the tunnel that Sloth made , where Olivier has Edward tell her everything . Edward and Falman deduce that the tunnel is being used as a giant transmutation circle for the philosopher 's stone , and that Amestris itself was formed for that very purpose . Olivier talks with Raven while the others listen in on the conversation , and gets him to spill about immortal armies . 36 `` Family Portrait '' `` Kazoku no Sh\u014dz\u014d '' ( \u5bb6\u65cf \u306e \u8096\u50cf ) December 13 , 2009 March 12 , 2011 Hohenheim recalls when he had left his family , lamenting that his body would outlast that of his wife and sons .

As the Elric brothers go to search for Scar , their real intent to find May as well , Winry decides to accompany them . 38 `` Conflict at Baschool '' `` Bazuk\u016bru no Gekit\u014d '' ( \u30d0\u30ba\u30af\u30fc\u30eb \u306e \u6fc0\u95d8 ) December 27 , 2009 March 26 , 2011 Hawkeye receives a call from Mustang , but is unable to say anything in fear of being watched by Pride .

Miles explains to Scar that he joined the military to gradually change the way people think of Ishvalans . Since May and Marcoh need Scar to decipher his brother 's research , Miles offers to hide everyone at the fort , with Alphonse insisting on sparing the two chimeras . While Scar and company head for the fort via tunnels in the mines , Winry comes up with a ruse to make it look like Scar has kidnapped her to elude Kimblee , just before a blizzard sets in . However , as they head for the fort , Miles gets word that Olivier is no longer there , as it is being manned by the state alchemists . When Alphonse willingly goes into the blizzard to find and warn the group , he briefly sees his body and wonders if it is trying to get its soul back .

Meanwhile , Father dreams of ancient Xerxes , where Hohenheim had been raised as a nameless slave , known only as Number 23 . There , Hohenheim had met Homunculus , a being in a flask who was created from his blood , which gave Hohenheim his current name and taught him the basics of alchemy . One night , Homunculus had been summoned by the King of Xerxes , who asked Homunculus to tell him the secret for immortality . Homunculus had tricked the king into making a gigantic transmutation circle , using the whole country as a sacrifice , while it and Hohenheim stood at the center of the circle . When Hohenheim had awakened , everyone else in Xerxes was dead , except for Homunculus . It had created a body shaped like Hohenheim for itself , then becoming known as Father . Back in the present , after Hohenheim awakes from this shared dream , he runs into Izumi and Sig .

As Scar and company exit the mine , they find Alphonse , who warns them about Central Command Headquarters infiltrating Briggs Fortress , so Scar decides to take them towards an Ishvalan slum . Miles attempts to snipe Kimblee , but Kimblee has already figured out the trap and uses a cover of snow to enter the mines . Edward tries to follow , but is attacked by two more chimeras , Darius and Heinkel . Edward disables them by using the ammonia in dynamite to make a stink bomb to overwhelm their high sense of smell . Edward then knocks the philosopher 's stone out of Kimblee 's hand , but Kimblee uses another philosopher 's stone hidden inside his mouth , sending Edward and the chimeras down a mine shaft and leaving Edward impaled by a steel bar . At the same time , Alphonse starts to drift out of consciousness , saying his soul is being drawn back to his body . Remembering the promise he made Winry and determined not to die , Edward gets the chimeras to remove the bar while he sacrifices some of his life span to temporarily fix the wound and to stop the bleeding . The chimeras find the philosopher 's stone that Kimblee dropped , and , thankful for their rescue , decide to take Edward to a doctor . 42 `` Signs of a Counteroffensive '' `` Hangeki no Kizashi '' ( \u53cd\u6483 \u306e \u5146\u3057 ) January 31 , 2010 April 23 , 2011 Alphonse , after regaining consciousness , realizes he was dismantled by the group to carry him back to the tunnels .

Zampano brings Envy to Marcoh , where Marcoh reveals that it was their intention from the start to lure the homunculus out there , and Envy is easily hit and outsmarted by the multiple alkahestry traps set up by May . Out of anger , Envy transforms into his true form and begins to attack the group .

However , Hohenheim reveals his countermeasure , for having spent years traveling the country , placing fragments of his own philosopher 's stone into the earth to use as foundation for returning the Amestrian souls to their original bodies . The stone fragments are activated by the eclipse 's umbra , as the souls are ripped from Father 's body back into their bodies , which forces a weakened Father to relinquish the Eye of God . As the eclipse then lifts , Bradley becomes blinded with sunlight , allowing Scar to kill him . Scar activates the nationwide alkahestry circle that his brother and fellow Ishvalans had been preparing , which restores the use of alchemy at the greatest potential . Unable to fight in his unstable body , Father retreats above ground to find more souls and replenish his stone supply . Edward remains behind to fight Pride while everyone else chases Father . Pride tries to steal Edward 's body to replace his own deteriorating one , but Kimblee 's soul reappears within him and taunts him while Edward enters his body and destroys it , reverting him to the form of a small fetus - like creature . Edward spares Pride 's life and leaves to join his friends . 62 `` A Fierce Counterattack '' `` Seizetsunaru Hangeki '' ( \u51c4\u7d76 \u306a\u308b \u53cd\u6483 ) June 20 , 2010 September 10 , 2011 Hohenheim and the others stop Father from making more philosopher 's stones , but as Edward rejoins them , Father spawns humans resembling the people of Xerxes before attacking with a powerful blast which takes out half the headquarters . They barely manage to survive the blast , but Alphonse and Hohenheim take some heavy damage protecting the others . Before Father can kill Edward and Izumi , the Briggs Fortress soldiers , along with several of Edward 's allies , join up to attack Father and use up his stone supply . Father lets down his barrier temporarily to try to absorb Greed 's stone , giving Edward , Armstrong , and Izumi the opportunity to damage him to the point of defending himself manually . As Father starts to lose control , he creates a blast which traps Edward 's arm while his automail arm is destroyed . With Edward in danger , Alphonse convinces May to help him perform a transmutation , trading his soul for the return of Edward 's right arm . Alphonse rejoins with his body on the other side and with his arm returned , Edward frees himself to unleash a series of blows on Father . 63 `` The Other Side of the Gateway '' `` Tobira no Muk\u014dgawa '' ( \u6249 \u306e \u5411\u3053\u3046 \u5074 ) June 27 , 2010 September 17 , 2011 While being effortlessly pummeled , Father desperately tries to absorb the philosopher 's stone from Greed . However , Greed , who decides to part from Ling 's body , uses his carbonization ability to turn Father 's body into weak charcoal . Father extinguishes Greed 's soul , but Edward punches through Father 's chest , releasing all the souls of the people of Xerxes and sending Father to the Gate of Truth where he is trapped for eternity . In the wake of Father 's defeat , everyone mourns Alphonse 's sacrifice . Edward rejects using a philosopher 's stone to bring him back to life , even after Hohenheim offers his final life as an apology for the pain the Elric brothers were forced through . Edward ultimately decides to perform a human transmutation on himself , sacrificing his own gate and his ability to use alchemy with it . As a reward for discovering he does not need to perform alchemy , Edward is allowed to bring Alphonse back with him in his original body . As everyone recuperates from the battle , Hohenheim returns to Resembool and dies peacefully before Trisha 's grave . 64 `` Journey 's End '' `` Tabiji no Hate '' ( \u65c5\u8def \u306e \u6daf ) July 4 , 2010 September 24 , 2011 Deciding to help sort out Ishvalan policies , Mustang is approached by Knox as well as Marcoh , who offer him a philosopher 's stone to get his eyesight back , though Mustang insists it be used to fix Havoc 's legs first . Olivier secretly rescues Scar so that he can assist Miles in rebuilding Ishbal . Having previously seen off Ling , who had promised to take care of May 's clan among others once he becomes emperor , the Elric brothers return to Resembool where Winry awaits them . Two years later , Grumman , who had become F\u00fchrer , visits Bradley 's wife , who had been raising up Selim to be a compassionate child . Alphonse decides to travel with Jerso and Zampano to Xing and other eastern countries to learn about alkahestry , while Edward learns what he can in the west , hoping to pull their research together . As Edward heads off , he and Winry finally express their love to each other using the term of equivalent exchange . The last shot shows Ed and Winry , now married with two children , accompanied by Al , May , Paninya , and Garfiel .",
